## About me

##### Having a decade of experience in the education and training industry focusing on outreach, industry engagement and even career coaching, I am bravely diving into the world of data science as a data analyst. 

##### Showcasing supervised machine learning, deep learning, text classification, exploratory data analysis or good old logistic regression - my portfolio of projects consists of different projects that I had embarked on during the course of my Data Science Immersive with General Assembly as well as my own personal projects. My favourite would be the brand insights projects which apart from EDA, encapsulated a variety of NLP models such as: SpaCy, LDA, Word2Vec and Doc2Vec. 
##### The rest of my projects are presented below with links to the actual code used:
