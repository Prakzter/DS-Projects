**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

5,1,"**Walmart Due Dilligence**

**PARTNERSHIPS**

\- Partnership with Instacart

Recently Walmart and Instacart have founded a partnership that will allow Walmart to use Instacart their same-day shipping service. \[Walmart and Instacart together make up for nearly 50% of the online grocery sales.\]( [https://secondmeasure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GroceryDelivery-chart2png-1024x631.png](https://secondmeasure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GroceryDelivery-chart2png-1024x631.png)) Walmart’s vast inventory and Instacart their network and experience will only strengthen their position as the dominant grocery delivery providers, and thus putting more pressure on Amazon.

\- Partnership with Shopify

In addition to Instacart Walmart has also partnered with Shopify. This new partnership will allow third-party sellers to directly sell their item’s on the Walmart marketplace. This new partnership will greatly expand Walmart’s inventory while giving small businesses the opportunity to reach a bigger demographic. Walmart is expecting to add 1200 Shopify sellers in 2020. Listing an item on Walmart’s marketplace allows Walmart to pick up some fees and generate greater traffic to the website. Another interesting possibility to consider is the fact that Walmart could be used as a Shopify returns hub, with a Walmart being within 10 miles of 90% of the US population it is the ideal candidate for further strengthening their relation with Shopify and saving both parties a lot of money.

\- Partnership with ThredUp

Walmart has also partnered with Thredup. ThredUp is basically an online thrift shop for clothes and wearable’s. This brilliant partnership means Walmart can now offer both normal and high-end clothing on their marketplace for an affordable price and expose customers to nearly 750,000 pre-owned items. Who would’ve ever thought you could tell someone that you bought your Michael Kors or Calvin Klein at Walmart.

\- Google

Walmart has been partners with Google for over 3 years now. This partnership allowed Walmart to enter the domain of voice ordering groceries. Simply ask one of your Google devices to buy milk and it will add milk to your Shopping cart. This Partnership might just be the beginning of a strong bond between Google and Walmart as both companies are interested in competing with Amazon.

\- Microsoft (+ Possible TikTok acquisition)

Walmart has been partnered with Microsoft for about 2 years with 3 more years to go.

Since the partnership Walmart has been using the full range of Microsoft cloud solutions in a bid to accelerate their digital transformation, innovation and efficiency.

**Acquisitions**

\- Bonobos, ModCloth, ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, Parcel

Let’s start at the beginning, with these acquisitions Walmart stated entering the e-commerce market in 2016-2017. Sadly as is known none of these are particularly success stories with the companies being sold again, being discontinued or CEO’s leaving. However Walmart learned a lot from these companies and has used this knowledge to further try to expand in the e-commerce market.

\- Jet.com

The first big step in the fight against Amazon. When amazon acquired Jet.com it was a clear signal of what its intentions were. Jet.com was one of the fastest growing U.S. e-commerce companies and Walmart acquired them in September 2016. Since then a lot has happened, Jet.com has been discontinued but the knowledge, progress and technology gained due to Jet.com is irreplaceable and has given Walmart a brilliant boost into the e-commerce with their e-commerce sales increasing 29%. Furthermore (ex)CEO of jet.com Marc Lore is now the CEO of Walmart’s e-commerce.

\- Flipkart

Ever heard of the small startup company called Flipkart? Maybe you have not, you should though. Flipkart owns 35% of the Indian e-commerce market, a true giant. Walmart acquired Flipkart in 2018 and ever since then it has been expanding its influence in India and fighting against Amazon for market dominance. This year Flipkart took over Walmart’s 28 Indian stores in order to expand its wholesale growth. Another interesting thing is that Walmart might make Flipkart public within the next 3 years.

\- TikTok acquisition

Some very recent news of their Partnership with Microsoft is to potentially acquire TikTok. TikTok’s enormous userbase and the current pressure in the US and India have made for an interesting situation causing the partnership to push forward in the bid to acquiring TikTok. In my opinion Walmart has a very decent chance of getting TikTok and making it work. One factor that plays a big role in this is Walmart’s presence in India due to Flipkart. Flipkart is India’s biggest online store for; phones, electronics, books, home appliances, etc. With Walmart having a presence in both countries where TikTok is (going to be) banned might mean some positive things for the future, but for now that is speculation. The acquisition of TikTok would allow Walmart to use its genius algorithm and massive userbase to further promote and integrate its Walmart marketplace.

**Walmart PLUS**

Word is finally out, in September Walmart will be launching its Amazon competitor called Walmart plus. It will give numerous benefits to the user such as; Unlimited free delivery(with 2700 stores having same day delivery), fuel discounts and scan&amp;go a tool to make shopping faster, all for the price of $98 per year

**2 Hour Delivery**

Walmart recently launches its new delivery service, called Express Delivery. This new service will allow customers to place their order online and receive their groceries (for a 10$ fee) within 2 hours. Walmart express delivery is currently available in 800 stores with plans to expand to 2000 stores. In addition to 2 hour delivery Walmart also offers same-day delivery in almost the entire United States.

**5000+ US stores.**

This is Walmart’s biggest weapon. The thing Amazon lacks the most is physical stores. Walmart has over 5000 stores while Amazon has just over 600 (worldwide!). If Walmart can find a way to combine e-commerce with its enormous physical presence then it could give Amazon an absolute run for its money. Remember that 90% of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart.

**Some other interesting facts to consider.**

\- 90% of US population live within 10miles of a Walmart.

\- Walmart’s e-commerce sales are currently up 97%

\- Walmart’s expansion in Africa, India, China.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion/TLDR**

Let me first state with you that this has been my first Due Dilligence and that English is not my first language.

Walmart is currently the underdog, and not many people are expecting them to properly fight Amazon. However its recent spree of partnerships and acquisitions have been a brilliant and very clear move in the direction of e-commerce. If Walmart fully utilized its massive physical network together when their growing fresh e-commerce, I see no other outcome then for Walmart to grow, grow, grow. Covid has given Walmart customers the push they needed to fully explore Walmart their marketplace, the marketplace that is now starting to fill up with thousands of sellers and endless products. Walmart VS Amazon, here we go, my money is on Walmart.

Hello Investors, today I am making a post on understanding the current state of the market. I have posted previously under the accounts [u/pleasantvibe](https://www.reddit.com/u/pleasantvibe/) and [u/stonksanalyst](https://www.reddit.com/u/stonksanalyst/) (yes this is my third account). These are confusing times, and even the elite experts can't fully make sense of *everything*. But, I'm not pretending to be omniscient, so let's get into it!

(TLDR is located at bottom of Post)

The biggest question I've seen asked is why has the market rebounded so quickly? The US GDP took a greater hit in Quarter 2 than the stock market crash of 1929. The single worst economic times in US history followed the 1929 crash, so WHY are we not seeing a hard hit stock market today? Two words, government assistance. The US government has spent **7 trillion dollars** in stimulus for the private sector. In case you haven't heard from anywhere else, that figure is astronomical. Many of you readers may have received this stimulus, whether it was in the form of a $1200 check, paycheck protection from the company you work for, or disaster relief for your business. That doesn't explain the whole story though. Putting money (mostly) in the hands of regular citizens and small business owners doesn't explain a stock price rebound for the world's Fortune 500 companies. Even with that money circulating back as spending, consumer spending is still down 1.2 trillion dollars from the first quarter of 2019. So what are the other reasons?

Another two words, Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has artificially lowered interest rates to what is effectively zero. Interest rates have been extremely low since 2009, but they were on a recovery track before this injection of capital into the economy. Low interest rates have a variety of different effects on the economy. Cheap loans, higher physical asset prices, and what I believe to be most important for this post, terrible fixed income prospects. Whether it be storing your money in banks, buying bonds or treasury notes, you **cannot even beat inflation** with any of these in the current times. Because of this people who are trying to create long term wealth have but one single option. The stock market. A total stock market index, which simply matches the return of the entire stock market, will out earn a 10-year treasury note three times over. This has brought investors pouring money into the market like a firehouse because there is simply no other option. With more buying of stocks, means higher stock prices because as you all know, as demand of something goes up, so does the price.

Another key thing to note is the accessibility of the market. In years before the internet where similar situations have occurred in the US and Global Markets, normal everyday folk couldn't simply just take their small earnings and stick them in the market. There were far more barriers to entry. Now with brokerage apps, fractional shares, and even no fee trading, anyone with a smart phone and one red cent to spare can be in the market. This adds as multiplier effect to the inflation of stock prices.

Finally, I have seen a trend of investors who believe that the government will continue to prop up the economy in times of disaster. While I think it is dangerous to assume such things, regardless, there is a level of confidence building that crashes that we've seen in the past may be just that. A thing of the past. This causes confidence to put your money (or leave your money) in the market even during bad economic times. This adds, yet again, another multiplier to stock prices.

TLDR: Government assistance and low interest rates have caused people looking for a return that will beat inflation to rush to the stock market. Since the stock market is easier to access than ever, this is why we see stock prices that don't reflect the state of the global economy.

Happy Investing,

""About 41% of U.S. public-school districts need to update or replace their HVAC systems in at least half their schools, representing about 36,000 schools nationwide, according to a report published in June by the U.S. Government Accountability Office.

My grandma bought me stock when I was younger, about 20 years ago. She was the custodian on the account but it was under my social.

She was getting the dividend checks directly to her all these years. I finally figured out that I actually had these stocks through from my uncle. When I finally found out how to access the portfolio I saw that the tax docs for the 1099 div had my info but for 20 years I never received a single dividend.

Do I owe taxes for dividends that went to my grandma and not myself? How do taxes work on an account like this? There are about 20 uncashed dividends for the past few years (She's very old now like over 100 and no longer ""with it"") so I was going to cash them since they are in my and her name. But now im freaking out about taxes. I am happy to pay taxes that I owe on dividends i receive but do I owe back taxes for the ones that went to her and she cashed all these years?

Does anyone have any insight on this or am i freaking out over nothing? How do taxes work on a custodian stock portfolio account?"

25,1,"If you are looking to bet on a vaccine. Here is a pretty good breakdown of each contender.

GENETIC CODE VACCINES #mrna #pfe

The Moderna and Pfizer candidates began Phase 3 testing in late July.

Neither uses the actual coronavirus. Instead, they’re made with the genetic code for the aptly named “spike” protein that coats the surface of the coronavirus. Inject the vaccine containing that code, called mRNA, and the body’s cells will make some harmless spike protein — just enough for the immune system to respond, priming it to react if it later encounters the real virus.

These mRNA vaccines are easier and faster to make than traditional vaccines, but it’s a new and unproven technology.

TROJAN HORSE VACCINES #azn

Britain’s Oxford University and AstraZeneca are making what scientists call a “viral vector” vaccine but a good analogy is the Trojan horse. The shots are made with a harmless virus — a cold virus that normally infects chimpanzees — that carries the spike protein’s genetic material into the body. Once again, the body produces some spike protein and primes the immune system, but it, too, is a fairly new technology.

Two possible competitors are made with different human cold viruses.

Shots made by Johnson &amp; Johnson began initial human studies in late July. The company plans to begin Phase 3 testing in September in as many as 60,000 people in the U.S. and elsewhere.

China’s government authorized emergency use of CanSino Biologics’ adenovirus shots in the military ahead of any final testing.

‘KILLED’ VACCINES #sva

Making vaccines by growing a disease-causing virus and then killing it is a tried-and-true approach — it’s the way Jonas Salk’s famed polio shots were made. China has three so-called “inactivated” vaccine candidates against COVID-19 made this way.

Sinovac has final studies of its candidate underway in Brazil and Indonesia. Competitor SinoPharm has announced plans for final testing in some other countries.

Safely brewing and then killing the virus takes longer than newer technologies. But inactivated vaccines give the body a sneak peek at the germ itself rather than just that single spike protein.

PROTEIN VACCINES #nvax

Novavax makes “protein subunit” vaccines, growing harmless copies of the coronavirus spike protein in the laboratory and packaging them into virus-sized nanoparticles.

There are protein-based vaccines against other diseases, so it’s not as novel a technology as some of its competitors. But it only recently finished its first-step study; the U.S. government’s Operation Warp Speed aims for advanced testing later in the fall. Vaccine Stock Plays"

I will show you a copper/gold mining stock that is mining 2 open pits while building a huge underground mining complex that is so enormous, it'll be a mine for over 100 years.   Next year it'll mine 550,000-600,000 oz. of gold and 250K tons of copper.

Get this... It sells for just over $1 (from $22high). PE is  5, and next year will be under 2!
Price/Book = 0.1  (i.e. valued at 10% of book value!)

And 3 years from now it'll start producing 650M+ tons of Cu and 500-650K oz of gold, all automated from underground mining at a cost of about 25c/ lb of Cu.  It will be an enormous cash cow, generating $6-10/share in earnings.

Why is it unknown and so cheap?  Its mine is located in Mongolia, about 25 miles near Chinese border.
It is majority owned by a  predator mining company called Rio Tinto.  It is being run by an ansavory character  (you can read it in the news), who employs funds to short its own stock to keep it dirt cheap with the intention to buy it all up once they secure the last agreement with government of Mongolia to swap its 1/3 ownership of the deposit for accelerated royalty payments.  Once this is done (sometime this year or early next), TRQ will most likely initiate a buy-out.  The value of the stock today should be over $4, and next year over $10, considering they'll produce over $1B in gold as a side product of copper mining.

Imagine... now valuation of the company is $1.7B, and next year they'll generate over $1.4B in sales.

55,1,"Here's a scenario I'm confused about. I'm trying to create a collar option with high dividend ETF. I saw this:

21 Jan 22

32 put

9 Oct 20  
40 call  
32 put

Questions  
1) In 1st scenario, does this mean that I'm paying $36.83 to have a collar option ... i.e I can sell 100 of underlying stock for $32 per share if it ever drops to that... but that i have to sell at 40 if stock price rise , and that I'm paying $36.83 to have this privilege?    


2) If I'm paying 35 for this stock... for $3500 (for 100 shares) stock value, i'm paying about 1% (36.83/3500) for this collar that expires on 21 Jan 22...? I don't know why but this sounds awfully cheap for insurance that expires that long. Why don't more people do it?  


3)  Why is there such little discrepancy for same collar that expires 9 Oct 20?   


4) I tried to create a zero cost collar and no matter what combination i tried using call/put on same expiration date, it was almost always debit... am i missing something? is zero cost collar not possible in  most real life scenarios? Collar option - is this understanding correct?"

65,1,"Here's a snippet from a podcast I've listened to (by Peter Schiff) a week or so ago, thought I'd share it here:

&gt;Doesn't the stock market reflect the earnings of the economy? Well, no, it reflects the earnings of the companies that are part of the stock market. The vast majority of businesses in America are not publicly traded. They're not in the Dow 30; they're not even in the S&amp;P 500 or the Wilshire 5000. They're privately held companies, so they're not part of it.  
&gt;  
&gt;So, if you look at the makeup of the publicly traded companies especially on a market cap basis, which companies are doing the best? Amazon, Netflix, those type of companies. \[...\] What's happening today is heavily impacting smaller companies, mom-and-pop type companies. These are the ones that are struggling, and so, since these big companies now have less competition from smaller companies, that benefits the stock market.  
&gt;  
&gt;So to say, oh look, the stock market is booming, that means we have a strong economy. We don't. It is the weakness in the economy that is benefiting the stock market, and the weaker the economy gets, the better it's going to be for the stock market. Because what happens when the economy is weak? The Fed prints even more money, we get bigger stimulus. It does nothing for Main Street, it *sedates* Main Street, but it continues to pump air into the stock market bubble.

**TL;DR** Most companies are not listed on any major stock exchange. When you see the S&amp;P 500 up on the year, it's not the economy that's roaring. It's the mega cap FANG stocks, large-cap multinational retailers like Walmart and Target, big pharma, fintech, etc. None of the stock indexes reflect small businesses or even the overall economy. Don't look at the stock market to gauge the health of the economy, look at the economic indexes. Why the stock market is disconnected from the economy"
66,1,"**Factset: How You can Invest in Hedge Funds’ Biggest Investment**

**Tl;dr FactSet is the most undervalued widespread SaaS/IT solution stock that exists**

If any of you have relevant experience or are friends with people in Investment Banking/other high finance, you know that Factset is the lifeblood of their financial analysis toolkit if and when it’s not Bloomberg, which isn’t even publicly traded. Factset has been around since *1978* and it’s considered a staple like Bloomberg in many wealth management firms, and it offers some of the easiest to access and understandable financial data so many newer firms focused less on trading are switching to Factset because it has a lot of the same data Bloomberg offers for half the cost. When it comes to modern financial data, Factset outcompetes Reuters and arguably Bloomberg as well due to their API services which makes Factset much more preferable for quantitative divisions of banks/hedge funds as API integration with Python/R is the most important factor for vast data lakes of financial data, this suggests Factset will be much more prepared for programming making its way into traditional finance fields. According to Factset, their mission for data delivery is to: “Integrate the data you need with your applications, web portals, and statistical packages. Whether you need [market](https://www.factset.com/products-data/market-data), [company](https://www.factset.com/products-data/core-company-data), or [alternative data](https://www.factset.com/products-data/alternative-data), FactSet flexible data delivery services give you normalized data through APIs and a direct delivery of local copies of standard data feeds. Our unique symbology links and aggregates a variety of content sources to ensure consistency, transparency, and data integrity across your business. Build financial models and power customized applications with FactSet APIs in our [developer portal](https://developer.factset.com/)”. Their technical focus for their data delivery system alone should make it stand out compared to Bloomberg, whose UI is far more outdated and complex on top of not being as technically developed as Factset’s. Factset is the key provider of buy-side portfolio analysis for IBs, Hedge funds, and Private Equity firms, and it’s making its way into non-quantitative hedge funds as well because quantitative portfolio management makes automation of risk management and the application of portfolio theory so much easier, and to top it off, Factset’s scenario analysis and simulation is unique in its class. Factset also is able to automate trades based on individual manager risk tolerance and ML optimization for Forex trading as well. Not only does Factset provide solutions for financial companies, they are branching out to all corporations now and providing quantitative analytics for them in the areas of “corporate development, M&amp;A, strategy, treasury, financial planning and analysis, and investor relations workflows”. Factset will eventually in my opinion reach out to Insurance Risk Management a lot more in the future as that’s a huge industry which has yet to see much automation of risk management yet, and with the field wide open, Factset will be the first to take advantage without a shadow of a doubt. So let’s dig into the company’s financials now:

Their latest 8k filing reported the following:

Revenue increased 2.6%, or $9.6 million, to $374.1 million compared with $364.5 million for the same period in fiscal 2019. The increase is primarily due to higher sales of analytics, content and technology solutions (CTS) and wealth management solutions.

Annual Subscription Value (ASV) plus professional services was $1.52 billion at May 31, 2020, compared with $1.45 billion at May 31, 2019. The organic growth rate, which excludes the effects of acquisitions, dispositions, and foreign currency movements, was 5.0%. The primary contributors to this growth rate were higher sales in FactSet's wealth and research workflow solutions and a price increase in the Company's international region

Adjusted operating margin improved to 35.5% compared with 34.0% in the prior year period primarily as a result of reduced employee-related operating expenses due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased 11.0% to $2.63 compared with $2.37 for the same period in fiscal 2019.

Adjusted diluted EPS rose 9.2% to $2.86 compared with $2.62 in the prior year period primarily driven by an improvement in operating results.

The Company’s effective tax rate for the third quarter decreased to 15.0% compared with 18.6% a year ago, primarily due to an income tax expense in the prior year related to finalizing the Company's tax returns with no similar event for the three months ended May 31, 2020.

FactSet increased its quarterly dividend by $0.05 per share or 7% to $0.77 marking the fifteenth consecutive year the Company has increased dividends, highlighting its continued commitment to returning value to shareholders.

As you can see, there’s not much of a negative sign in sight here.

It makes sense considering how FactSet’s FCF has never slowed down

&amp;#x200B;

FactSet’s annual subscriptions and professional services have made its way to foreign and developing markets, and many of them are opting for FactSet’s cheaper services to reduce costs and still get copious amounts of data and models to work with.

Here’s what FactSet had to say regarding its competitive position within the market of providing financial data in its last 10k: “Despite competing products and services, we enjoy high barriers to entry and believe it would be difficult for another vendor to quickly replicate the extensive databases we currently offer. Through our in-depth analytics and client service, we believe we can offer clients a more comprehensive solution with one of the broadest sets of functionalities, through a desktop or mobile user interface or through a standardized or bespoke data feed.” And FactSet is confident that their ML services cannot be replaced by anybody else in the industry either: “In addition, our applications, including our client support and service offerings, are entrenched in the workflow of many financial professionals given the downloading functions and portfolio analysis/screening capabilities offered. We are entrusted with significant amounts of our clients' own proprietary data, including portfolio holdings. As a result, our products have become central to our clients’ investment analysis and decision-making.” ([https://last10k.com/sec-filings/fds#link\_fullReport](https://last10k.com/sec-filings/fds#link_fullReport)), if you read the full report and compare it to the most recent 8K, you’ll find that the real expenses this quarter were far lower than expected by the last 10k as there was a lower than expected tax rate and a 3% increase in expected operating margin from the expected figure as well. The company also reports a 90% customer retention rate over 15 years, so you know that they’re not lying when they say the clients need them for all sorts of financial data whether it’s for M&amp;A or wealth management and Equity analysis:

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/factset.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/factset.asp)

FactSet also has remarkably good cash conversion considering it’s a subscription based company, a company structure which usually takes on too much leverage. Speaking of leverage, FDS had taken on a lot of leverage in 2015:

So what’s that about? Why were FactSet’s long term debts at 0 and all of a sudden why’d the spike up? Well usually for a company that’s non-cyclical and has a well-established product (like FactSet) leverage can actually be good at amplifying returns, so FDS used this to their advantage and this was able to help the share’s price during 2015. Also, as you can see debt/ebitda is beginning a rapid decline anyway. This only adds to my theory that FactSet is trying to expand into new playing fields. FactSet obviously didn’t need the leverage to cover their normal costs, because they have always had consistently growing margins and revenue so the debt financing was only for the sake of financing *growth*. And this debt can be considered covered and paid off, considering the net income growth of *32%* between 2018 and 2019 alone and the EPS growth of *33%*

EBITDA has virtually been exponential for FactSet for a while because of the bang-for-buck for their well-known product, but now as FactSet ventures into algorithmic trading and corporate development the scope for growth is broadly expanded.

P/E has declined in the past 2 years, making it a great time to buy.

Increasing ROE despite lowering of leverage post 2016

Mountains of cash have been piling up in the coffers increasing chances of increased dividends for shareholders (imo dividend is too low right now, but increasing it will tempt more investors into it), and on top of that in the last 10k a large buyback expansion program was implemented for $210m worth of shares, which shows how confident they are in the company itself.

SGA expense/Gross profit has been declining despite expansion of offices

I’m a bit concerned about the skin in the game leadership has in this company, since very few executives/board members have significant holdings in the company, but the CEO himself is a FactSet veteran, and knows his way around the company. On top of that, Bloomberg remains king for trading and the fixed income security market, and Reuters beats out FactSet here as well. If FactSet really wants to increase cash flow sources, the expansion into insurance and corp dev has to be successful.

Summary: FactSet has a lot of growth still left in its industry which is already fast-growing in and of itself, and it only has more potential at its current valuation. Earnings September 24th should be a massive beat due to investment banking demand and growth plus Hedge fund requirements for data and portfolio management hasn’t gone anywhere and has likely increased due to more market opportunities to buy-in.

132,1,"Hi I have a question;

Context: Been investing for over a month. 75% up total. Just now realized I have no idea what’s happening... at all...

Question: When the options price at the end of regular trading hours is adjusted for the beginning of trading hours the next day, is the price adjustment gradual or is it a sudden adjustment to a new equilibrium? 

Ex: Options prices for JAMF fell during after-hours due to a disappointing earnings report. Options have yet to reflect this change in price. Come 9:30AM, will the 9/18 $35C price be essentially Dutch Auctioned, or will it suddenly be a new equilibrium price? Not sure if it’s a quick and linear change to a new price ~or~ suddenly a new change. Bought the prior mentioned call for $450. It is now valued at $810. JAMF went from $41 at 1:50 to $37 during after-hours. I set a limit sell for $800 which is $10 lower than the current bid price. 

Also, is there a way to quantify after-hours prices to start-of-next-day options prices? How should I approach this? Question: How are Options prices determined from the previous day end to the beginning of the new day?"

134,1,"(Little background) I am currently 23 years old, this is my first year of investing and I have been reading several books about investing and Warren Buffett. Besides that am I currently learning how to read for example financial reports of companies and researching their investor pages about future plans.

  
My first stock is Royal Dutch Shell, to be more precise: RDSB Amsterdam. Since I bought the stock (mid August), it went up a tiny bit and so far has been going down consistently.

&amp;#x200B;

Negatives:

1. I know various factors play a role into this. First of all Barclays has lowered the investment advice of Shell. I have seen this impact the price of the stock even though it bounced a little back up. 
2. I know due to COVID-19 a lot of the consumer consumption of oil/gasoline is lowered since people work from home for example. 
3. Shell has lowered their dividend rate from 47 cents to 16 cents. 

&amp;#x200B;

Positives:

1. The crude oil price is consistently going up and is already at the price where Shell can profit. (This is partially thanks to their lowered dividend rate).
2. The stock is extremely low price compared to what it used to be. Especially for the amount of assets Shell has in the market.
3. Shell is moving towards a green sustainable future. They are investing into all kinds of renewable energy such as solar, wind, etc.  [https://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/new-energies.html#iframe=L3dlYmFwcHMvMjAxOV9uZXdfZW5lcmdpZXNfaW50ZXJhY3RpdmVfbWFwLw](https://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/new-energies.html#iframe=L3dlYmFwcHMvMjAxOV9uZXdfZW5lcmdpZXNfaW50ZXJhY3RpdmVfbWFwLw) 
4. Joint venture between Shell and Eneco to build several wind farms in The Netherlands.

I have a rather fundamental question:

When I buy an AMD stock that was on the market for $91, and I expect it to rise and I press purchase, there is a 20 minute delay.

This year, I broadened my stock portfolio to a number of conservative long term companies like KO, APPL, HD, MA etc. My main metric when picking a stock has been the target price. If there is more upside than downside and media surrounding the stock is positive I generally buy. If a stock gets close to its target price and the price isn't raised or the industry looks like it is going down, I sell.

**Apple Inc.** shares are up 6.1% and **Tesla Inc** shares have gained 10% this week after both companies implemented stock splits starting on Monday. The [big post-split gains](https://www.benzinga.com/news/20/08/17319989/apple-tesla-continue-crazy-hot-streak-on-first-day-of-split-adjusted-trading) have many market experts scratching their heads, especially considering investors have known the splits were coming for       weeks.    

Seabreeze Partners President and Tesla short seller Doug Kass said Apple and Tesla making new highs following their splits “makes ZERO sense.”  Kass recalled a story from when he was a child and was upset when he       thought there would not be enough pizza for him because his family had       cut an 18-inch pizza into just six slices rather than eight.    

“This silliness, and embracing of post-split shares of Tesla and Apple, is nothing short of stupid – as I was many decades ago,” Kass said.

“Did Tesla report fabulous earnings? Win a major new contract? Announce it was entering a massive new market? No… The stock began trading after a 5-for-1 split that it announced three weeks ago,” Tilson said.    

Tilson said today’s tech sector is extremely reminiscent of the dot com bubble. However, he also warned traders about the dangers of going short or selling stocks, even in the middle of a bubble. Tilson said today’s market reminds him more of early 1999 than the peak of the dot-com bubble in March 2000. 'Nothing Short Of Stupid,' Hedge Fund Manager Says Of Post-Split Gains In Apple And Tesla"

On going political and social issues around the globe, and the underlying fear behind Covid-19 still stifling economies are just some of the problems investors are having to deal with. When it comes to making conscience decisions during these cloudy periods, its important to remain true to your strategy. Whether its value, dividend, bonds, ETF's, or prospective investing, having a game plan has never been more important. Looking at balance sheets and valuating companies on growth potential has never been more important. And cash, cash per share has an amplified influence on a companies value in these waters.

**ABBV**; The 170 billion dollar Drug manufacturer is set to make over $12 a share this year and is recording 17% earnings growth this year, 18% next, sales up 26% last quarter, and pays a 5% dividend.

Even if the stock doesn't move much in the near term, sales and earnings are growing, and that's what's important here.

I recently learned what options are. And I’ve come to pick up a little on “swing trading” by others’ posts (still not even sure if I understand it completely). 

My ultimate question is: when an options contract comes due, say 9/4 (sept 4), 100 shares of a stock at $30, for example. The stock on 9/4 is at $60. Do I pay the $3,000 and then decide on whether I want to sell the 100 for $60? So essentially, I’m clarifying that I do, in fact, transfer the money to receive the stock, right? 

And then, say I’m at 9/3 and the stock is looking hot near $100. I can sell my option stock to someone right? How does one profit off that? 

Sorry if my logic is completely wrong and doesn’t make sense. I can’t understand it without examples.

A couple of days old, but thought it was interesting. Glad no one was hurt. Not sure if TSLA has seen any changes based on it.

ZEBULON, N.C. (AP) — The North Carolina Highway Patrol says a Tesla driver had his car on Autopilot mode and was watching a movie on his phone when he crashed into a sheriff’s deputy’s car.

A state trooper and a Nash County deputy on Wednesday were on the side of U.S. Highway 64 and responding to a previous crash when the Tesla slammed into the deputy’s cruiser. No one was hurt.

“Luckily, the state trooper pushed our deputy out of the way when he heard the tires squall and in an instant we could have lost a life or several lives. It could have been very horrific,” said Nash County Sheriff Keith Stone.

Authorities charged Devainder Goli of Raleigh with violating the move-over law and watching television while operating a vehicle.

Tesla has repeatedly said its Autopilot system is designed only to assist drivers, who must still pay attention.

EDIT: “Not sure if TSLA has seen any changes…” I meant, “Not sure if the stock price has seen any changes…” Patrol: Tesla Autopilot driver was watching movie, crashed"

Long time lurker, first time poster - decided to sign up for this (lol).

With all the hype that been surrounding EVs, especially ones that have yet to even deliver a vehicle (lets not name names), curious why there isn't more hype surrounding GreenPower Motors ($GP)?

GreenPower is a company based out of Vancouver, Canada that recently IPO'd on the NASDAQ. Although they did so in a reverse 7:1 split (which I found a bit odd), the entire company seems quite promising. They recently had their [Q12021 Financial Results](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/greenpower-reports-fiscal-first-quarter-2021-financial-results-301121251.html), and I was personally quite impressed (especially because these results factor in Covid). A few highlights from the results and their quarterly call:

* Reported revenue of $2.27 million generating a gross profit of 27.2% of revenue and 100 re-orders of their vehicle (much better than their competitors)
* Level 5 autonomous driving being tested with Jacksonville transit authority.
* Wireless charging partnership with momentum dynamics
* NASDAQ listing enable opportunity for ETF’s and other funds to buy into GP. They estimated around 21 have already bought into other competitors.

I feel like this has a lot of potential, especially with the buy America/ eco-friendly sentiment that is currently going on. Their management team also seems quite transparent and they have an actual product manufactured! Would love to hear everyone else's opinion and hear a contrasting viewpoint :).

517,1,"I have been shaking my head, just as many others have, as I have watched the market rally back to new highs since the major selloff in March.

However, after a couple months of being “absolutely sure” the market would sell off again and make new lows, I had to swallow my pride and admit I was wrong - at least for the short term.

So I dipped my toe back in and have done relatively well...yet now I have some new concerns. We are no longer talking about a market making new highs simply on the back of a very shaky economy. Now, we have a market being pushed, almost daily, to new highs - largely on the back of the large cap tech sector.

In particular, AAPL has gone completely vertical! The P/E on the shares is now over 40 - WAY above the 5 year and 10 year highs!

So, to my question. Do fundamentals even matter any more? Are we entering a new era in the stock market?

It’s seeming more and more that since commissions have been eliminated for self-directed trades, the market is being pushed higher by Main Street savers who are frustrated with sub 1% rates that are looking for a better return rather than informed Wall Street investors and traders.

I am reading more and more posts from people who are euphoric about the market - encouraging friends to get in and get some of this “easy money”!

This should be a MAJOR RED FLAG to experienced investors. When there is euphoria and everyone is buying, that is as sure of an indicator as the market will ever give you that a top is imminent!

If you haven’t already done so, consider scaling back a bit and taking some of your profits off the table.

No matter how nice it seems today, the market can not continue going up at this pace indefinitely! Do traders even care about fundamentals any more?"

My original purpose was to avoid anything that's too inflated, and textbook says PER above 15 is bad. Even XLV's PER scares me but nowdays cant ask for too much.

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has acquired a slightly more than 5% stake in each of the five leading Japanese trading companies.

Berkshire acquired the holdings in Itochu Corp., Marubeni Corp., Mitsubishi Corp., Mitsui &amp; Co., and Sumitomo Corp. over a roughly 12-month period through regular purchases on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

Based on Friday's closing prices for the trading houses, a 5% stake in each would be valued at roughly $6.25 billion.

Berkshire says it intends to hold the investments for the long term, and that it may increase its holdings in any of the companies up to a maximum of 9.9%, depending on price. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway buys stakes in Japan's five leading trading companies"

892,1,"The company's value will rise without a stock split if it's a good company. But I'm asking if a stock split can nudge it along a bit faster.

Talking about the increased market liquidity from a stock split. The cash from more market liquidity can help pay short term bills meaning some expenses like materials and such. If you don't believe a stock split increases market liquidity or marketability then never mind I'll just move along.

Anyway the theory goes if it's easier to pay short term bills then it will help somewhat to keep its research &amp; development going for the production of products the public loves to buy. And so the increased sales could nudge along the value of the company a little faster.

The elites in this subreddit will say a stock split won't help in this way or at all because it doesn't affect the business fundamentals of a company. And that's probably true for most or almost all cases. But for example can anyone accept that a stock split can in some cases help a company reach a big market cap a few years earlier in a long term run? Like in 18 years with stock splits as opposed to 20 years without stock splits. 

I know its hard to know what its market value will be in 20 years. It's just theory. But a whole other thread for something more concrete would be if Apple's stock splits from 2000 to 2011 made it rise faster during that period ending in 2011. Can a stock split help a company's rise in value go a little faster?"

For those looking to buy JETS or get into airlines I’d advise doing so after the share decline that is pretty likely coming late September and early October. This should give you less risk as FED money is what is keeping the airlines afloat right now so prices should go to what they would be without that aid once it ends.

1141,1,"Hey All,

Assuming this was your piggy bank, how would you nurture $76,000 currently tied up in GPN (Global Payments) stock via selling and reinvesting? 

The majority of these GPN shares would incur long term gains, and I’ve made an excellent ROR; however, I was eyeing BRKB and MSFT, last month bc both were trading at $180, the same price of GPN, but have outpaced me likely for good. 

Would you divest say half into a mix of blue chips, let it ride, or else? 

I’m 30yo and have $175,000 in 401k via various Vanguard mutual funds along with 
$29,000 in a Vanguard Roth Ira, so the ‘reinvested amount’ would ideally be drawn on in the semi-near as well as long term.

The UN Working Group is considering regulations and a new classification system of lithium batteries based on risk factors such as chemistry, form factor, quantities of flame, heat and gas released, and whether they propagate when a cell is intentionally forced into thermal runaway. 

A new classification system would require lithium battery manufacturers to test batteries to assess and better understand the risk they pose in transport. The objective is to incentivize battery manufacturers to understand the risks posed and to design safer batteries.

1378,1,"So I know next to nothing about stocks.  (Mechanical Engineer is my profession) But I am currently up 105% since March when I bought my first stocks ever.

I actually decided to throw all the cash I had on hand in the market into CCL at $9.50 or something around there. (I had about $39,000 at the time)  I am currently up $41,000

I Sold my shares at $22, then I re-bought in at $18.


I'm fairly certain I'm going to make at least a 300% gain within a year or two as CCL slowly recovers from COVID.  but I was prepared to lose it all.  (will need to hit $30 for me to make a 300% gain) 

I know this wasn't even a smart play (then again I am up over 100% so it wasn't dumb either)  it was just painfully obvious IMO.  to the point where I was hesitant to buy at first because I thought.  (it cant be this easy can it?)

Anyway I am going to continue holding CCL willing to for another few years if need be.   

...but it got me thinking I might just stay out of the market entirely until another black swan event happens in the next 10-15 year or whenever.

then just do the same thing I did this time,  throw all my money in, wait for the recovery, then be done with stocks again (besides 401k). you could likely make another 300% gain or something crazy in the matter of a year or two..  

Anyone else with a similar story? Black Swan Events"

Good evening (as of CET) people of r/stocks.

I would really appreciate if you guys could help me  out with something.

I just got out of university, got a real job and decided to invest a little of my income. 

When the price for crude oil went down early this year, I decided to buy some.

Being European I got myself an ETF that's supposed to track the price for Brent Oil. (Gullible as I am I thought 30€/barrel was incredibly low an the perfect moment to pitch in.)

The ISIN is PS701L.

So here's my question: The price of crude oil went up, but my ETF didn't.

You can see it quite clerarly on this chart:

So Tesla share was $2,213 Friday. Today the share was $$498. If the share was not split 5-1, does that mean the share would be 5x $498, total $2,490?

Another question...Let's say I bought $5k in Tesla shares today, total 10 shares. 10 months later the share went to $2,000 and I sell all my 10 shares. Will that 5-1 split affect the $20k when I sell the share?

1389,1,"Logged in today (because for some reason it's gratifying to see my new share balance after a stock split) only to find my portfolio balance significantly (though not astronomically) higher than it should have been.

Lets say I owned 100 shares of TSLA at the cutoff: I should have 500 post-split, but my account shows a balance of 900. (4x100 + initial 100 vs. 4x100 + 4x100 + initial 100)

Update: I’m pretty surprised to see how much (proportionally) people have in the market! Mostly 80-100%!

If the market took a dump long term, there’d be a ton of people that would be absolutely screwed. What PERCENTAGE of your net worth is in the stock market?"
1394,1,"Having good risk management practices is fundamental to any trading or investing strategy, as it will help to keep potential losses in our pockets. As the Oracle of Omaha always puts it “Rule #1 is not to lose any money, and rule #2 is never to forget rule #1”. At the end of the game, long term success will only be achieved if we live to fight enough days and get the necessary experience.

With this in mind, here are five simple Risk Management tips that any trader or investor should take into account when navigating the markets.

1. Asset Allocation: This one applies more to an entire portfolio than a single trade. Essentially this means to diversify across the types of trade you hold at any given moment. The diversification can apply to different companies within an industry, different industries in general, even trades with different time horizons, or using puts and shorts to hedge positions.
2. Position Sizing: Position sizing refers to the portion of your complete account that you are using to buy an asset. If you are looking at the screen every second and twitching with every tick, then probably you have not developed the mindset to handle that amount of money. The good part is that if you are serious in becoming a trader, with every trade you make your tolerance goes up which allows you to keep placing bigger bets.
3. Buying in tranches: Basically this means not buying the full position in one go. You could buy in halves or thirds. This will allow you more time to manage a trade and make sure you are feeling comfortable, especially in tricky markets.
4. Use stop Losses: For traders we must keep in mind to take small losses quickly, for investors this is a bit less so. Depending on the strategy you can use different type of stops such as trailing stop losses either with percentages or absolute values. Hard stop losses which is an order at a specific price. Or closing day stops where you sell the next morning if a stock closes the day below a certain price.
5. Review your time horizon: there are many different strategies that are played in different time horizons. For example, day trading is extremely fast making multiple trades per day. Momentum and swing trading you hold either a day to a couple of weeks. Value investing you can hold anywhere from a couple of months to years. And finally things like dividend investing you would hold to forever.

ES futures are on a massive run this week after breaking all time highs. Suports remain at 3465 area so as long as we stay above these levels, I will continue to look for healthy bullish setups. A move below that area will signal a short term bear movement. I won't enter a bearish position until a break of 3400, but I will definitely be in risk off mode.

**Top Watch:**

On Thursday I entered a bullish position using October 50 and 55 strike calls on INTC as we begin a move for the $52 area gap-to-fill.

Friday afternoon another setup showed on my radar. SPG is making a shift on the daily and looking for another solid breakout. I entered October 75 calls for this breakout. There’s clear resistance around $95 if this picks up momentum, but I will likely take partial profit on the way up.

1958,1,"From 2010 to 2019, not a single stock in the S&amp;P 500 performed better than Netflix did. Today, the company counts nearly 200 million subscribers across its global streaming platform. At any one time, Netflix accounts for 12-15% of all global internet traffic. And its market cap of $231bn makes Netflix more valuable than Bank of America, AT&amp;T, or Comcast. If you invested $1,000 in the Netflix IPO in 2002, those shares would now be worth $437,888 for a total return of 43,688% – or annualized returns of 39.51% over the past 18 years. 

But if it weren’t for a bad pitch to Blockbuster, Netflix may have never started the streaming revolution. Did you know that Netflix was originally called Kibble? That Walmart was once the biggest threat to its business? Or that the company nearly launched a “Netflix Box” to download shows instead of offering a fully on-demand streaming service? In the latest featured flashback, we profile how Netflix went from just another dot-com to category inventor, with quite a few ups and downs in between. 

**The Amazon.com of “Something”**

* Early legend had it that Netflix CEO and co-founder Reed Hastings got the idea for Netflix after Blockbuster charged him a $40 late fee for Apollo 13. He has since conceded that he told that story to encapsulate the Netflix ethos and business model. The more widely accepted version is that both Hastings and co-founder Marc Randolph both greatly admired Amazon and wanted to replicate their success by becoming the next Amazon.com of “something”. 
* In 1997, DVD players were still uncommon and could cost upwards of $700, making them an expensive upgrade over the mainstay VCR. Originally, the duo considered a VHS mail-in service but ultimately decided that shipping video cassettes would be too costly. When they test-mailed a CD to their homes and it arrived in the same condition, they thought they were onto something. 
* After securing funding (including $25,000 from Randolph’s mother), Netflix opened its first distribution center in San Jose in 1998. Back then, the business model was to charge $4 per rental plus $2 for postage. They only had a skeleton staff and fewer than 1000 titles among their collection. But that didn’t prevent Jeff Bezos from making an offer for Netflix to spur Amazon’s entry into the movie rental business. 
* The company rejected the offer but continued to struggle financially before moving to a subscription model in late 1999. Netflix figured that overnight delivery was possible from San Jose throughout the Bay Area, and local consumers were quick to sign up for a flat rate fee in exchange for unlimited movie rentals. That year, Netflix also signed revenue-sharing agreements with several major studios. 

**Dot Com Bubble Burst and Near Collapse**

* Although by 2000 Netflix now counted about 300,000 subscribers, the company was burning through an unsustainable rate of cash - $50 million that year alone. To draw in new subscribers, they offered generous deals and free trials. And the combination of only $20 monthly subscriptions for unlimited DVD rentals with a reliance on the US Postal Service meant that the company didn’t have much promise of improving its cash flow. 
* Plans to go public were scrapped when the dot com bubble burst. On top of that, the tech collapse caused venture capital money to dry up throughout the Valley. Unlike during the two or three previous years, investors were no longer willing to back dot com companies that had yet to turn a profit. According to an account from Randolph, Netflix thought the best option to stay in operation was to try and sell part of the company to Blockbuster – the dominant player in the rental market that had 7,700 retail locations at the time. 
* In early 2000, Hastings and Randolph flew to Dallas to meet with Blockbuster. Netflix wanted to maintain its independence by offering a 49% stake but agreed to take on the name Blockbuster.com. The idea was that Netflix would become the online division of Blockbuster. When Blockbuster asked how much it would cost for the whole company, Hastings replied “$50mn”. Not only did Blockbuster decline the arrangement, Randolph noted that Blockbuster CEO John Antioco [struggled not to laugh](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/09/netflixs-crazy-doomed-meeting-with-blockbuster) when Hastings named his price. Instead, Blockbuster signed a 20-year video-on-demand agreement with Enron Broadband Services. 
* Soon after this, though, DVD sales began to gain major traction and the cost of mass-producing DVDs fell to $1 per unit. On the back of the rise in DVD players, Netflix more than doubled its customer base to 750,000 towards the end of 2002. Even still, many had doubts about the future of the company and its shares hovered around pre-split levels of $6 ($0.42 on a split-adjusted basis at today’s float). Wall Street even likened Netflix to infamous dot-com failures such as Kozmo or Webvan. 

**Enter Walmart, then Blockbuster**

* Despite Wall Street’s skepticism, Walmart became intrigued by the success of Netflix and launched an identical service in early 2003. Not only did Walmart undercut Netflix’s $19.95/month subscription with a rate of $18.86, they rivaled Netflix on selection. Hastings reacted to Walmart’s entry by saying he was “glad” and that it “will benefit Netflix.” Numerous attempts to keep undercutting Netflix on price didn’t work, and Hasting’s suggestion that Walmart’s presence in the rental market would help Netflix actually proved to be true. 
* With DVDs now becoming a popular mode of watching entertainment, the major obstacle preventing subscriber growth was convincing people to rent DVDs online. The entrances of Walmart in 2003 and Blockbuster in 2004 into the market greatly enhanced public understanding of the subscription-based DVD rental model. In fact, marketing by Walmart and Blockbuster had a knock-on effect for Netflix. 
* With lower competitor prices and similar libraries, one of the key advantages for Netflix was its algorithm-driven recommendation feature. Prior to Netflix, box-office hits received the vast majority of rental revenues as it was difficult for consumers to learn about less well-known movies. At the time, 80% of Netflix rentals came from 2,000 titles – completely inverting the previous model of brick-and-mortar rental. 
* The success of Netflix in promoting a wider range of films made the platform extremely popular with studios as a marketing vehicle and alternative mode of movie advertising versus traditional media. Blockbuster had also been sitting on a mountain of rental data, but unlike Netflix, they never utilized it to build out their online service. Eventually Walmart abandoned online DVD rentals in 2005 and even struck a deal to convert its subscribers to Netflix in exchange for Netflix promoting Walmart’s in-store DVDs for purchase.

**The Start of Streaming** 

* In 2002, it cost $30 in bandwidth to download a DVD-quality movie online. But by the mid-2000s, internet speeds were now fast enough that it became feasible to think about sending content digitally. In 2005, the company thought the best way forward was to sell a “Netflix Box” that customers could download movies to then be able to watch them the next day. The product was about ready to launch when some began having second thoughts. Around this time YouTube was experiencing incredible success and growth. Rather than restrict Netflix streaming to a specific hardware device, the company decided to make its new web-based on-demand service hardware-agnostic. 
* Netflix began streaming its movies and TV shows directly to subscribers’ devices in 2007 – more or less ending the rental wars that began at the start of the decade. At the end of that year, Netflix had 7.5 million subscribers, marking 24x growth in its user base in just over seven years. While Amazon also launched a streaming service that year, Netflix enjoyed a dominant market share at 91%. A few years later in 2010, Blockbuster had filed for bankruptcy protection and Netflix shares were hitting all-time highs. 
* Even after the exit of Blockbuster and its near monopoly on streaming for a time, Netflix experienced a couple of growing pains that caused analysts to question its future on more than one occasion. The most notable of these occurred in 2011 when the company decided to split its DVD rental and streaming plans while it was still mailing 14 million DVDs to customers. The result was that customers who wanted streaming and DVD rental had to pay 60% more per month than before. When the company announced it had lost 800,000 subscribers in its Q3 FY11 earnings report due to the move, shares plunged 35%. Shares had reached a pre-adjusted split high of nearly $300 that summer before falling to $78 in October.

**Original Content, International Expansion, and Media Giant** 

* Over the next few years, though, Netflix began significantly investing in original content and moving its platform into new markets. From 2011 to 2015, Netflix expanded into Canada and Europe, across Latin America, and began to gain a foothold in Asia. However, perhaps just as important to the new leg of growth was the start of original content in 2013 with the launch of “House of Cards”. While the move into original content required major capital investments by Netflix, it also reduced licensing fees and furthered the value proposition for the platform as some of its shows gained critical acclaim. 
* The dual strategy led to Netflix growing subscribers from 70.8 million in 2015 to 167.1 million in 2019 (63.5% of whom were international-based). In 2017, US-based Netflix subscribers equaled the combined number of cable subscribers for the first time. And in 2019, 6 of the top 10 streamed television shows in the US were Netflix original content. With Disney, Comcast, AT&amp;T, Apple, and others pushing heavily into streaming with a combination of high-value content and deep pockets, it remains to be seen who will ultimately win the streaming wars. But there is no doubting the immense success Netflix has achieved in reinventing how we consume entertainment, and their shareholders have been rewarded greatly.

Furthermore, I saw that alot of companies stock is hundreds of dollars more expensive that the price/share you get by dividing the equity by the number of shares.

It’s cool being technically the most valuable car maker but other than massive cash outs for people who bought/were paid in stocks when they were $30 and having a easy way to get more capital through selling small amounts of shares, it’s seems it has massive downsides. Stock buybacks become impossibly expensive and it doesn’t change the profitability of your core business, just shifts interest to the stock market side rather than the actual products and profitability.

I have no clue on shares, I get that a higher stock price shows faith in a company but Tesla’s valuation is definitely artificial and I can’t really see it helping the company, only individuals that have invested with the intention of selling.

2280,1," August has produced two issues that portend a stock market reversal, particularly for popular favorites like Apple [AAPL](https://www.forbes.com/companies/apple) [\+299.4%](https://www.forbes.com/companies/apple), NVIDIA [NVDA](https://www.forbes.com/companies/nvidia) [\+4.1%](https://www.forbes.com/companies/nvidia) and Tesla [TSLA](https://www.forbes.com/companies/tesla) [\+394.3%](https://www.forbes.com/companies/tesla):

* A burst of optimism, especially for fast rising stocks
* Bearish developments in all-time high stocks

Likely, a quick, sharp correction (\~10% drop) could temper the optimism. However, the more rapid risers, where optimism is especially high, might be in for a larger fall. Therefore, now looks to be a good time to raise cash for potential opportunities ahead.

*Disclosure: Author sold all-time high stock holdings and is holding cash reserves*

Here is the explanation behind those two issues:

### First, the burst of optimism

*Note: Don’t expect this stock market’s rise to continue its unbroken string of up-days, weeks and months****.*** *Instead, view the stock market as being in a variable trend pattern, with enthusiastic rises followed by corrections. Such a pattern keeps a bull market in check and healthy.*

Therefore, think of this stock market trend as being a multi-act play with two, alternating actors: Pollyanna, who counters every concern with positive assurance, and Chicken Little, who is in a perpetual state of concern, supported by his book, “The Worrywart’s List of What Could Go Wrong.”

PROMOTEDGrads of Life BRANDVOICE | Paid Program5 Ways Employers Can Support Black Employees: A Young Leader’s AdviceUNICEF USA BRANDVOICE | Paid ProgramEducation, Not Marriage: Building Better Futures For Girls In EthiopiaCivic Nation BRANDVOICE | Paid ProgramThe Obstacles That Strengthen You

Investors too often view the stock market, itself, as the indicator of which message is accurate. Therefore, Pollyanna now commands the stage.

Originally, she was greeted by catcalls, as she tried to push Chicken Little aside. Now, with the market steadily rising, her fan base has grown, and she is cheered daily. Supporting the increased optimism is her message that normality and growth in 2021 will put the coronavirus recession behind us.

Does that mean we are in the clear? No. You can still hear Chicken Little in the wings, along with his loyal followers, chanting, “Watch out!” And, despite his diminished following, his message endures: All the uncertainties, alternate paths and eventual results remain viable. Therefore, don’t accept those assurances of normality and growth returning soon.

Last week I came home to find my mailbox was stuffed  w/ 6 fat packages from Eastern Bank (3 kids have passbook savings, and my wife and I  have 2 savings and a checking account). At first glance I thought it was a new policies and procedures disclosure update. I was surprised when I  saw they were going public! Been an EB guy for close to 30 years.

They are primarily found in Massachusetts. This is what the google gave me:

**Eastern Bank** is the oldest and largest mutual **bank** in the United States and the largest community **bank** in Massachusetts. With 95 **branches**, **Eastern** had a 3.2% market share in Massachusetts in 2016.

They are offering account holders stocks @ $10/each if you had an account on or before March 31st. I have never been part of a bank getting a ticker, nor would I even begin  to know which existing publicly traded banks to look at for an equal comparison. I an considering picking up a couple hundred shares, and taking money from each child's savings passbook (which is making next to dust with the interest rates) and buying 100 each for them and will let them have it at 18 and they can do what they want with them at that point. (Edit: I think this will also be a great learning experience for my 3 spawns to hopefully get them to be smart with some of their loot and invest).

Here is the link to their prospectus:

2632,1,"It feels like there is a lot of priced in speculation in today’s market regarding autonomous vehicle and their impact on various industries. Specifically around Tesla and Uber. I believe a lot of the expectations and assumptions are AV tech are misguided and fail to properly consider the impact government regulation will have on the economic value of this technology. 

Let’s start with Uber. Even before this pandemic, Uber was in bad shape financially, consistently losing money every quarter ON TOP of dealing with negative brand image. A narrative I’ve heard time and time again is “Don’t worry, self driving cars will come soon and will be much cheaper for them than the drivers are now.” 

I think at BEST, we are still five years away from seeing any serious uptick in self driving cars on the road, and realistically it’s probably more like 10 to 15 years. So Uber has many, many more years ahead of it in which it will need to deal with its expensive drivers. 

And when the tech is finally ready on a large scale, how exactly is it going to be cheaper? Safer sure, but cheaper? Let’s put the cost of developing tech or licensing on the shelf for now, and just think about the legal costs of compliance. As it stands, Uber has insanely complex compliance challenges operating in markets all over the globe, and these challenges are likely to become more complex with the introduction of AV, resulting in even higher compliance costs for them! 

On top of this, there’s a good chance they won’t even be allowed to use self driving cars in their biggest markets! NYC will probably ban self driving cars outright, because that’s just what they do with this kind of thing. Expect other large cities to follow suit. 

This is a good segway into the Tesla side of things: Tesla. Lots of people say “Tesla isn’t just a car company! It’s a tech company!” So let’s look some of their best tech: self driving cars. 

Tesla isn’t the only one in this space, there’s also Google, Uber and others. Cars and road safety is one of the most heavily regulated segments of society not just in the USA but other developed nations. But let’s just think about the USA for now. As this technology matures I think it’s very likely that the NHTSA will mandate technological standards and inter-compatibility across the industry. This means that a large part of the value of the tech, the exclusivity part of it, could go out the window once these companies are forced to start sharing with each other and work together. Not saying it kills the value, not at all! But it does mean the value takes a big hit. The government won’t be the only ones pushing for this, insurance companies will too. Insurance companies aren’t going to care about who gets to profit most from what tech, they are just going to want it to work to the highest safety standards possible and will work with the government to push that agenda. 

Overall I think def driving cars represent a good value proposition. But the idea that the tech is going to be a limitless money printer is simply misguided. Car saftey is one of the most heavily regulated areas of society, and that’s not going to change with the AV “revolution”. These regulations are going to put safety first, and will likely mute some of the profit potential some investors are hypothesizing about with certain companies. 

Please share your thoughts respectfully! This is not meant to be diligent research or “haha look I proved it” just my own thoughts opinions based on my experience and observations! 

TLDR: People love speculating on the profit potential for self driving cars but seem to not properly consider the impact inevitable government regulation will have on the way the tech comes to market. Regarding the future and self driving cars"

# **Stocks head into September in high gear as Apple and Tesla split, and markets await the August jobs report  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/28/stocks-start-september-in-high-gear-as-apple-and-tesla-split-and-markets-await-the-august-jobs-report.html)**
*****
&gt; September is historically challenging for the market, but stocks could start the month on an upswing after what looks to be the best August for the S&amp;P 500 in at least 34 years.
*****
&gt; The week ahead will be busy with Fed speakers and economic reports, including the important August employment count Friday. Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida speaks at 9 a.m. ET Monday on monetary policy. He is is one of several officials, who are expected to reiterate Chairman Jerome Powell’s Jackson Hole message that the Fed would be willing to let inflation run hot temporarily to help the economy and job market.
*****
&gt; The low volume days of late summer should be a hallmark of the week ahead, but there could also be window dressing trades around the month’s end, as investors rebalance holdings.
*****
&gt; On Monday, there could be some excitement around two of the market’s favorite stocks. Apple begins trading after a 4-for-1 split. Tesla is also trading on a split-adjusted basis starting Monday, after it split its stock 5-for-1. Apple’s split changes its weight in the Dow, so the index is being adjusted and there will be new names in the index Monday as some old ones leave. ExxonMobil, Pfizer and Raytheon will be replaced by Salesforce.com, Amgen and Honeywell.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up 3.2% in the past week, and it could continue to make gains in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; “I think we’re still going to be basking in the the glow of an accommodative Fed, combined with the increased accessibility of Apple’s share price to retail investors,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Stovall said that after its last split in 2014, Apple gained 36% over the next year, but after its 2000 split as the tech bubble burst, it lost 60%. Apple has risen more than 30% since announcing its stock split on July 30.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was on track for a more than 6.9% gain in August, its best performance since 1986 if it holds that level through Monday. The S&amp;P recovered and surpassed its all time high during the month and is now flirting with the psychological 3,500 area.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has on average lost 0.5% in September, its worst month of the year going back to World War II, Stovall said. When the S&amp;P 500 has gained more than 5% in August, September gained an average 1.4% and was positive in four of the seven years also back to the 1940s, Stovall said.
*****
&gt; # Jobs, jobs, jobs
&gt; Economists are slightly more optimistic about the economic data in the third quarter, but the job market has been an area of concern with unemployment claims still running around 1 million a week. According to Refinitiv, economists expect 1.4 million jobs were created in August, down from 1.76 million in July. The unemployment rate is expected to fall to 9.8% from 10.2%.
*****
&gt; “I’m assuming we just continue the momentum we saw in the prior month,” said Aneta Markowska, Jefferies chief economist. Markowska said the monthly number has been difficult to forecast because the lack of correlation with unemployment claims, typically a strong barometer for monthly payrolls data but not as much since the pandemic.
*****
&gt; “What we’ve seen really in the last two to three months is a sharp snapback in the hiring in the sectors that were most depressed in Covid. You have restaurant workers, leisure workers coming back,” Markowska said. “At the same time, you’re seeing a much smaller wave of layoffs in other industries. There was a second order knock-on affect, as a result of profit weakness and companies trying to cut costs as a result of that.”
*****
&gt; Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo, said there’s been a debate in the market for the last several weeks about whether jobs gains are beginning to flatline.
*****
&gt; “It strikes me that if you get a better-than-expected number that probably sends risk assets flying, but a somewhat worse-than-expected number would have less impact,” he said.
*****
&gt; Schumacher said the market may pay some attention to so far floundering efforts in Washington for a new stimulus package. But he added the market has been ignoring the issue for now, as Congress appears to be getting further apart.
*****
&gt; “We are worried about the impact on these small businesses if there’s no bridge for the next six months,” he said.

&gt; # Fed message
&gt; After Powell spoke at the Jackson Hole symposium Thursday, Treasury yields moved in a wide range. The 10-year note was as low as 0.65% and as high as 0.78% Friday, before settling in at about 0.74% in afternoon trading Friday.
*****
&gt; Powell said the Fed would be willing to let inflation rise a bit above 2% for awhile, and that it would now target an average without moving to tighten policy.
*****
&gt; “The market reaction to Powell was a little confusing. I suspect the Fed did not want to see this back-up in nominal yields and I suspect they’ll push against it,” said Markowska.
*****
&gt; Fed watchers said the message from Powell was that the Fed will likely keep rates lower for a longer period. Bond strategists said the market was responding to the idea of higher inflation, and rates were rising, particularly at the long end of the curve.

&gt; # S&amp;P 500 Stocks: Worlds Apart

&gt; If you've been paying attention this year, you know that the S&amp;P 500 has been carried by the performance of the index's largest components, and the chart below illustrates just how wide the disparity has been. It shows the YTD performance of each of the S&amp;P 500's members sorted by their market cap heading into 2020 with the largest stocks on the left side and the smallest stocks on the right. So far this year, the 50 largest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are up an average of 11.3% YTD, and if we were to take an even narrower look at just the ten largest stocks heading into the year, the average YTD gain is over 27%!

&gt; While the largest stocks are up a lot this year, the next 400 stocks in terms of market cap haven't fared nearly as well, averaging a decline of 2.0%. That's not great, but considering the pandemic this year, even a 2% decline isn't such a bad thing. The same can't be said for the smallest stocks in the S&amp;P, however. As shown below, the 50 smallest stocks are down an average of 15.3% YTD, and more than two-thirds of them are down!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/0827-Individual-stocks.png))**

&gt; Another way to illustrate the declining fortunes of stocks this year based on their size is by looking at a moving average of YTD stock performance across the market cap spectrum, In the chart below, the first point on the chart represents the performance of the 50 largest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 which have gained an average of 11.3% YTD. The next point to the right represents the average YTD change of the stocks that ranked between number 2 and 51 in terms of market cap at the start of 2020, and we continue that process down the entire list of components to the point where the last point in the series on the right side of the chart represents the average performance of the 50 smallest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 heading into the year. As mentioned above, that group of stocks has averaged a decline of 15.3% YTD. The performance of the 50 largest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 ranks as the fourth-best of 451 different points on the chart, while the basket of the 50 smallest stocks ranks as the 29th worst performing basket. In 2020, the bigger the stock, the better the returns.

&gt; # Which Bull Will It Be?

&gt; The incredible rally off the March 23 bear market bottom continues, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up more than 50% from those fateful lows. It feels like a lifetime since the longest bull market ever ended. Remember though, although the recent bull market was the longest, it wasn’t the greatest, as the 1990s bull gained more on a percentage basis.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.26.20-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; We discussed in detail what the new highs in the S&amp;P 500 meant here, so we won’t dive into that again. But this time we’ll show just how this rally ranks versus others that ended major bear markets. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this new bull market, up to this point of about five months, is stronger than any other major bull market’s start going back to World War II.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.26.20-blog-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “Yes, this new bull market is the strongest bull market we’ve ever seen after five months,” explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But that shouldn’t be a source of worry. The previous two strongest rallies up to this point were in 1982 and 2009, and both saw continued strength during the first year of the new bull market.”

&gt; Here is a chart showing just this bull market and the ’82 and ’09 bull markets.

&gt; # September Almanac: Only Modest Improvement in Election Years

&gt; Start of business year, end of summer vacations, and back to school made September a leading barometer month in first 60 years of 20th century, now portfolio managers back after Labor Day tend to clean house Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979). Sizable gains in September 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2017 have lifted Russell 2000 to second worst (since 1979). September was creamed four years straight from 1999-2002 after four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble buildup.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e4e433c87c6e4c76cefda4ccffbf5ab0/cfdd6d36ba180c35-7f/s400x600/836cc65ffaba5c46d56ea4566614d200638be344.jpg))**

&gt; Bullish election-year forces do little to improve on September’s poor overall performance over the same time frame. September’s performance does improve slightly in election years, but it is still negative nearly across the board. Only the Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have been able to escape negative territory and post modest 0.2% and 0.8% average gains respectively in the last ten election year Septembers.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks. Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning August 31st, 2020"
2640,1,"  have been fishing like crazy since the pandemic started. I noticed that everything is flying off the shelves at the fishing supply store. And another store. And another store. It seems like everyone has just come into the sport like me now that social distancing is the law of the land.

Thing is, for me at least, I don't think this is passing. I have found a new lifelong pit to sink my money into. I've had success in the past investing in what I personally as a consumer purchase. And I feel like there might be some successful companies in this space. But I'm not such a knowledgeable consumer that I could definitely pick one as the long term success vs another.

 I thought of Shimano, which seems to be the preferred reel manufacturer. However, I noticed there are two tickers, SMNNY and SHMDF? Can anyone tell me the difference between these two?

For context, I'm talking about Visa specifically: I would've expected a much higher volatility due to the recent price increase, however the ATR is still really low while the RSI signals obviously overbought; see daily chart:

https://ibb.co/JHZCkPW

According to the Pivot Point Standard it has already broken 2 resistances (R1: 198.70 / R2: 206.67 / R3: 212.33), the next one being 217.98.

Since it's an uptrend, should I take it as a signal that there is still room for Visa to grow?

2648,1,"Insider Buying

On Wednesday it was reported that Marcus Lemonis, CEO of **Camping World Holdings** $CWH, acquired 32,250 common shares in the outdoor lifestyle co. in multiple transactions on Aug. 24 and Aug. 25 for approximately $1million.  It has been a pretty good year so far for Camping World as RV sales are up 8% and the company is undeniably getting a sales bump from the pandemic, longer-term migration out of densely populated cities thanks to cloud computing and remote work. But CWH sees further opportunity as households are increasing seeking access to the outdoors. It estimates some 11 million American households have an RV, and since it operates in just 36 states, there's a possibility it can continue to expand its footprint with approximately eight to 10 new stores a year.  With a PE of 12.0 the valuation looks very reasonable.

On Friday, **Pacific Ethanol** $PEIX jumped 9% after reporting insider purchases (including the CEO and CFO) totalling $390,000.  It’s always good to see insiders buyinto strength and with PEIX up 10x since March the CEO and CFO both seem to believe it has further to run.   The ethanol business has many regulations that act as barriers to entry and the company has benefitted from the COVID pandemic given the huge growth in demand for high-quality alcohol for cleaning and sanitation supplies.  PEIX has already guided for full year EBITDA of $76mn.  Next year, with increased capacity and the (currently ongoing) repricing of 1 year contracts, $100mn looks reasonable.  Beyond that is anyone’s guess but the current valuation at $235mn does look cheap.

&amp;#x200B;

Growth Stocks

On Tuesday **BigCommerce Holdings** $BIGC spiked 37% after the company announced that its e-commerce checkout service would be available through Facebook's Instagram app.  The app allows consumers to check out on Instagram, instead of leaving the app and going to a merchant's website to finalize an e-commerce sale and could help merchants (who sign up) more easily sell their products to Instagram’s 1 billion  users.  It could also help BigCommerce get a foot in the door with merchants before going on to cross sell other products and build their online store (similar to Shopify).  Shopify shareholders don’t seem too worried just yet.  Shopify is about 15x larger by sales, cashflow positive and building out a fulfilment network that could end up challenging Amazon.  Nevertheless, it’s a huge development for $BIGC who, with a market cap of just $8.8bn, are still at an early stage of growth with a long runway in front of them.  

Also on Thursday, **Dollar General** $DG reported strong comparable sales, up 18.8% in Q2, to top the consensus estimates of +14.9%. Same-store sales increased in each of the consumables, seasonal, home products and apparel categories, with the largest percentage increase in the home products category.  Margins were also up due to higher initial markups on inventory purchases, a greater proportion of sales coming from the non-consumables product categories (higher margins) and a reduction in markdowns as a percentage of net sales.  No formal full-year guidance was issued due to the pandemic but EO Todd Vasos was bullish saying ""We continue to operate from a position of strength and are excited to announce the acceleration of several key strategic initiatives, including the rollout of DG Pickup, DG Fresh, and our Non-Consumables initiative, as well as an increase in our expected number of real estate projects for fiscal 2020"".  The valuation at just 20x current year estimates looks very reasonable.

&amp;#x200B;

Value Stocks

On Tuesday **Toll Brothers** $TOL beat expectations in its Q3 with EPS of $0.90 and sales of $1.65bn versus forecasts of $0.71 and $1.5bn.  The company pointed to growing demand, driven by historically low interest rates, the undersupply of homes, and the COVID pandemic leading to consumers focusing on the importance of a home “more than ever.”  Forward looking gauges — pending sales, housing starts and building permits — suggest that, against all odds, the US housing market is holding up. The valuation at just 14x trailing earnings looks reasonable.

On Friday, **Big Lots** $BIG dropped 10% after reporting an outstanding set of results that beat top and bottom line forecasts.  Net sales increased 31% year over year to $1.25 billion and EPS of $11.29 ($2.75 after adjustment for sale and leaseback benefit) compared to $0.16 last year. The sale and leaseback transaction also transformed the balance sheet from a net debt of c.$400mn to net cash of $850mn.  That’s a significant amount for a company with a market cap of $2bn especialially given it has just announced the authorization to repurchase $500 million in shares.  All this makes Friday’s drop more bewildering. The stock price has soared since March lows, but with a trailing PE of 7.0 it still looks like good value.

3025,1,"Disclaimer: I am long 150 shares of NIO at a cost basis of roughly $10/share.

As with many electric vehicles, NIO’s small fleet of EVs (The ES8, ES6, and EC6) are priced at a premium compared to gas-powered vehicles of similar quality and size. Recently, NIO introduced their Battery as a Service Program (BAAS) which will allow consumers to purchase a car without a battery at a reduced price and then subscribe to a service program where consumers will “rent” their batteries and be able to swap them out for freshly charged ones at battery swap stations. A number of potential benefits of BAAS have been pointed out: increased resale value, faster recharge due to battery swaping, and the ability to use the most up-to-date battery technology in older vehicles. However, one of the most alluring aspects of BAAS is that it may allow NIO to compete with cheaper gas equivalents by lowering the sticker price of their vehicles. Here I will compare the purchase and upkeep costs of NIO’s vehicles to an equivalent gas-powered competitor (Volkswagen) both with and without the new BAAS pricing.

Obviously, any estimate such as this requires a number of assumptions which I will lay out here. Probably the most subjective part of this comparison is the selection of the competitor. I’ve chosen Volkswagen as they have consistently been the largest car brand in China (Almost 2x their closest competitors, Honda and Toyota, in terms of sales) Source: [https://carsalesbase.com/china-car-sales-analysis-2019-brands/](https://carsalesbase.com/china-car-sales-analysis-2019-brands/). They also sell a number of wide-range of vehicle types which are of good quality but are not luxury vehicles. This makes them easy to compare to a similar electric brand like NIO. The specific vehicle pairings are shown below in Table 1.  They are primarily based on size and seat number, something a consumer would immediately notice, not the performance of the vehicle. I also could not find good size numbers for the NIO EC6.

Table 1: Chosen Pairings of NIO and VW Models

|NIO Model|Vehicle Style|\# of seats|Wheel Base (mm)|Length (mm)|VW Model|Vehicle Style|\# of seats|Wheel Base (mm)|Length (mm)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|ES8|Full-size SUV|7|2997|5022|Atlas|Full Size-Cross Over SUV|7|2980|5040|
|ES6|Mid-size SUV|5|2900|4850|Atlas Cross Sport|Mid-size SUV|5|2980|4970|
|EC6|Cross-Over SUV|5|?|?|Tiguan|Cross-Over SUV|5|2791|4486|

While the cost of the BAAS is known (980 RMB/month), we do have to also make some assumptions about the monthly/yearly costs for the Volkswagen owner. The assumptions are as follows…

1. The average distance traveled per year by a Chinese driver is about 11,400 miles Source: [https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/17/12709/2017/](https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/17/12709/2017/)
2. Gas prices will remain around 6 RMB/L or 23 RMB/Gallon [https://www.globalpetrolprices.com/China/gasoline\_prices/](https://www.globalpetrolprices.com/China/gasoline_prices/)

Obviously, both of these numbers may have a wide range both geographically and temporally. I may examine some specific scenarios for people who drive less or more with higher or lower gas prices in the future.

3. The only upkeep cost for a NIO owner is the monthly fee for participating in BAAS. This is obviously not true but it simplifies our comparison

In addition to these assumptions, there are a number of known factors.

1. Participating in BAAS gives you a 70,000 RMB discount on your vehicle price
2. BAAS costs 980 RMB/month
3. Regular vehicles in China are subject to 10% sales tax which NIO vehicles are not subject to
4. The government will provide various subsidies for the purchase of NIO vehicles as shown below in Table 2

With these assumptions and knowns laid out, lets run the numbers… Table 2: Cost of Purchasing NIO Vehicle’s pre and post-BAAS

|Model|Vehicle Purchase Price (RMB)|Govt Subsidies (RMB)|Purchase Price pre BAAS (RMB)|Purchase Price Post-BAAS (RMB)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|ES8|468000|18000|450000|380000|
|ES6|358000|14400|343600|273600|

Table 4:Final Price Comparison

|NIO Model|Purchase Price Pre-BAAS (RMB)|Purchase Price Post-BAAS (RMB)|Yearly Cost (RMB)|VW Model|Purchase Price (RMB)|Yearly Cost (RMB)|   % Difference in price pre BAAS|   % Difference in price Post BAAS|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|ES8|450000|380000|11760|Atlas|317956|11918| 42% |19%|
|ES6|343600|273600|11760|Atlas Cross Sport|233478|11918|47%|17%|
|EC6|350000|280000|11760|Tiguan|190360.5|10764|83%|47%|

As shown above, the BAAS is not a perfect solution for NIO. The ES8 and ES6 still run at a 20% premium to their VW counterparts. However, this is a more than 50% reduction in the pre-BAAS price differential between the two brands and, even with the added subscription fee, the yearly cost of ownership is roughly the same. Closing this price differential is important for NIO even if it cannot completely match their competitors’ prices. There a number of other attractive things about owning a NIO vehicle which consumers might easily pay an extra 20% for but not an extra 40%. If its continued roll-out it successful, BAAS is likely to draw a number of new potential consumers to the brand who might have been priced out before.

I'm very interested to hear if anyone has critiques of this analysis or other thoughts about BAAS or NIO in general. Will BAAS (Battery as a Service) allow NIO to compete on price with gas equivalents?"
3026,1,"I believe I did pretty well in the market this year. My networth increased ~65% since its lowest point in March, [~350k to 620k](https://imgur.com/a/3Vu6u2f). 20k from the car I bought in March. I rolled over a 401k and it messed up Mint's reporting, hence the spike from Jul -&gt; Aug. 

I beat the [SP500 by 40%](https://imgur.com/a/adeDokD) in my YOLO account, my FAANG account went from [180-&gt;300](https://imgur.com/a/kBmBp1O)

I did this by following some basic investing principles, buying and holding for the most part, being patient, and only investing in areas which I have expertise in. 

I did not buy into the TSLA hype, nor do I play options, nor do I play crypto. 

#High level advice:
=========================================

I picked the 7 I agree with.

1. Invest in what you know…and nothing more.
2. Never compromise on business quality
3. When you buy a stock, plan to hold it forever
4. Diversification can be dangerous
5. Most news is noise, not news (don't read articles about investing)
8. The best moves are usually boring (buy and hold)
10. Only listen to those you know and trust 

I firmly believe that anyone who follows those concepts, they will find success in investing.  

#General mindset:
================
- Keep emotions out of the market
- Don't bother timing the market. Don't get ruled by FOMO.
- Understand that for some stocks, you can't really average cost down. You will have to stomach buying the stock at a higher entry point. My refusal to average up early on caused me to miss out on a lot of gains. 
- Understand the difference between trading, investing, and gambling. 
- Have an exit strategy (stop losses would have helped me a lot in March, I now learned from my expensive mistake)
- Be greedy-- not TOO greedy. If a stock pops 10%, I will sell half to lock in profits. It's super common to see a lot of companies pop and the next day dip a bit due to sell off. Perfect time to grab more on the dip. This is obviously impossible to time, which is why I only sell half. 

#Application:
==================================================================
I was very specific in the types of companies I would choose to invest in within tech. I decided to follow my strengths. As a data engineer, I'm very intimate with cloud technologies, and I think I generally have pretty sharp business acumen and good strategic direction. 

As a result, my day to day work had me using a ton of technologies in the cloud space. I've used Splunk, NewRelic, Twilio, AWS, GCP, Hortonworks/Cloudera, Oracle, Tableau, Datadog, Sendgrid (bought by Twilio), Dropbox/box, Slack, Salesforce, Marketo, Databricks, Snowflake, HP Vertica, just to name a few. I was familiar with CDN services like Fastly and Cloudflare because sometimes, I worked with the DevOps and IT guys. 

Based on industry hearsay, day to day work, eventually, I got a good ""feel"" of what technologies were widely adopted, easy to use, and had a good reputation in the industry. Similarly, I also got a feel for what tech were being considered 'dated' or not widely used (HP, Oracle, Cloudera, Dropbox, Box). 

I tend to shy away from companies that I don't understand. In the past, most times I've done that-- I got burned.  My biggest losers this year was betting on $NAT and $JMNA (10k total loss). After learning from those mistakes, I decided to only focus on investing in companies that either I or my peers have intimate first hand experience with using. Because of this rationale, the majority of stocks in my portfolio are products which I believe in, I thoroughly enjoy using, and I would recommend to my friends, family, and colleagues. 

Post COVID, due to the shift to remote work and increase in online shopping I decided to double down on tech. I already knew that eCommerce was the next big thing. I made very early investments into SHOP and Amazon in 2017 for that reason.

My hypothesis was that post-COVID, the shift on increased online activity, remote work, and eCommerce would mean that companies which build tools to support increased online activity should also increase. I decided to choose three sectors within tech to narrow down-- these were three sectors that I had a good understanding of, due to the nature of my work and personal habits. 

1. eCommerce + AdTech 
2. IT/DevOps (increased online activity means higher need for infra)
3. FinTech (increased shopping activity means more transactions)

These are the points I consider before I consider jumping into a stock:

1. Do I feel good about using the company? Do I believe in the company's vision?
2. Where do I see this company in 5 years? 10 years? Do I see my potential children being around to use these companies?
3. What does YoY, QoQ growth look like for this company? 
4. Is/Will this product be a core part of how businesses or people operate?
5. Who are their customers and target demographic?
6. (SaaS) Customer testimonials, white papers, case studies. If it's for a technology, I'm going to want to read a paper or use case.

In March, I took what I believe to be an ""educated gamble"". When the market crashed, I liquefied most of my non tech assets and reinvested them into tech. Some of the holdings I already had, some holdings were newly purchased.

*EDIT* ^^^ this isn't called timing the market you /r/wsb imbeciles. Timing the market would be trying to figure out when to PULL OUT during ATH and then buying the dip. I SOLD at the lowest point, and I with the cash I sold AT A LOSS, I reinvested that cash and doubled down into tech. If I sold in Feb, and bought back in March, that would be calling timing the market. What I am doing is called REINVESTING/REBALANCING... not timing the market. 

I have 50% of my networth in AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, FB, NFLX, and the rest in individual securities/mutual funds. I have 3 shares of TSLA that I got in @1.5.

Here are the non FAANGs I chose.

1. $SQ. I had already been invested in SQ since 2016. I made several bad trades, holding when it first blew past 90 until I sold it at 70... bought in again last year at 60s, after noticing that more and more B&amp;M stores were getting rid of their clunky POS systems and replacing it with Square's physical readers. After COVID, I noticed a lot of pop up vendors, restaurants doing take out. A Square reader made transactions very easy to make post-COVID. 

2. $ATVI. Call of Duty and Candy Crush print money for them. I've been a Blizzard fanboy since I was a kid, so I have to keep this just out of principle.

3. $SHOP. They turned a profit this year, and I think there is still a lot more room to grow. It's become somewhat of a household name. I've met quite a few people who mentioned that they have a Shopify site set up to do their side hustle. I've tried the product myself, and can definitely attest that it's pretty easy to get an online shop up and running within a day. I 5.5xed my return here. 

4. $BIGC. I bought into this shortly after IPO. I'm very excited to see an American Shopify. BigC focuses on enterprise customers right now, and Shopify independent merchants, so I don't see them directly competing. I'm self aware this is essentially a gamble. I got in at 90, sold at 140, and added more in 120s. I def got lucky here... it's not common for IPOs to pop so suddenly. I honestly wasn't expecting it to pop so soon.

5. $OKTA. Best in class SSO tool. Amazing tool that keeps tracks of all of my sign-ons at work. 

6. $DDOG. Great monitoring tool. Widely adopted and good recommendations throughout the industry. Always had a nice looking booth at GoogleNext.

7. $ZM. Zoom was the only video conf tool at work which I had a good time using. Adoption had blown up pre-COVID already in the tech world, and post-COVID, they somehow became a noun. ""Zoom parties"" and ""Zoom dates"" somehow became a thing interwoven into peoples' day to day lives.

8. $TWLO. Twilio sells APIs which allow applications to send messages like text, voice, and video chat. For example, when DoorDash sends you a text at 1 AM reminding you that your bad decision has arrived, that text is powered by Twilio. In March, New York announced that they were going to use Twilio to send SMS notifs for COVID contact tracing. 

10. $NET/$FSTY. These two two seem like the ones best poised for growth in the CDN space. This is based off of industry exposure and chatting with people who work in DevOps.

11. $DOCU. people aren't going to office to sign stuff, super easy to use, I like their product. 

12. $WMT. eComm, streaming, and a very substantial engineering investment makes me think they have room to grow. Also I really need to diversify. 

13. $COST. When is the last time you heard someone say ""Man I hate going to Costco and paying $1.50 for a hotdog and soda?"" Diversification. Also cheap hotdogs.

14. $NVDA/AMD. GPUs are the present and the future. Not only are they used for video games, but Machine Learning now uses GPU instead of CPU to do compute (Tensorflow for example). Crypto is still a thing as well, and there will always been a constant need for GPUs.

Mutual funds/ETFs
1. $FSCSX. MF which focuses on FinTech. 

2. $VTSAX Pretty much moves with the SP500. 

3. $WCLD. Holdings include Salesforce, Workday, Zuora, Atlassian, Okta, New Relic, Fastly... 

Titanvest:
I was an early access user, and I was able to secure 0% fees for my accout. 36% gains so far. I like them, because their portfolio happens to include shares of tech giants that I either don't have individual stocks for or my stake is low (CRM, PPYL). It nicely complements my existing portfolio.

#Some things I do that that are against the grain:

- Not really diversified. 80% is in tech. They are in very different sectors of tech, but the truth is, when tech falls, all of these companies fall. I'm obviously long tech and I do not believe that tech will fall anytime soon. What about the dot com bubble? There wasn't a single dot com company that was integral in our lives. The internet was in its infancy then. Techonology is now such an interwoven part of our lives and I see companies like Apple, Amazon, Google to be sticking around for several generations.

- I don't read investing articles. I think people who write articles about a stock all have ulterior motives-- to pump or to dump. Case in point-- Citron Research spent years writing articles telling people how SHOP was overvalued. Why did they do that? Because they were shorters at the time. I turned 5k into 27k, because I held on to most of my SHOP shares.

- I don't take much value from balance sheets, other than net loss, income, YoY growth. Instead, I use my business acumen to try to pick up on info that isn't super apparent from Google. For example, one thing I always do is that I look at the career page to see how the business is growing. Increase on marketing/sales/implementation engineers is typically a solid sign that a company is preparing headcount to take new deals in the upcoming quarters. I look at the product road map, supported integrations, and customer base. 

One example was how I applied the above principle was to WalMart. In 2018 I noticed that I was getting targeted by a lot of Data engineering job listing for WalMartLabs-- WarMart's tech division. The role was to build out a big data pipeline to support their eCommerce platform. WalMart's online store released in Q3 of 2019. Post COVID, I used their online store and it was a seamless experience. They even offer a 5% cash back card like Amazon. They reported strong Q4 sales last year, and they did very well post COVID. Why did I choose to invest in $WMT? Because I believe that Wal-Mart has room to grow for their online platform. 

Lastly... remember that wealth isn't accrued over time. It takes years to build. The quickest way to increase your wealth is by investing in yourself-- your career and earning potential. The sooner my income increased, the quicker I had more capital to buy into stocks. 

Also, if you've gotten this far, the point of my post isn't to say that you should invest into tech. The message I'm trying to get across is-- when picking companies, pick companies in fields or verticals you have good knowledge in. Heed Buffet's advice to only pick companies you believe in and understand. Play to your strengths, don't mindless toss money based on one person's posts on Reddit-- always do your own due diligence. Use DD as a guide and use personal research and experience to drive your decision. How I applied Buffet's strategies to my own portfolio, +70% networth, beat SP500 by 40%"

3028,1,"I did some research leading up to my purchase of shares Ormat Technologies last week. Allow me to make a short recap for you guys. For those who just don’t care: jump to the penultimate paragraph here.

Ormat Technologies (NYSE: ORA), established in 1965, is a geothermal company, located in Nevada. The company builds and operates sustainable power plants, based upon geothermal and recovered energy, around the world.

2020 wasn’t an outstanding year so far. The turnover in the first quarter was 3,5% below last year’s figures, the second quarter was about 5% less turnover. As a possible cause, it seems the destroyed (by a lava flow) power plant in Hawaii can be pointed out. Nevertheless, they are on track to restart the power plant by the end of this year. Another cause of the lower turnover can be sought in the fact that there’s a slight decrease in the sales of building power plants since the second quarter.

If we take a step back, and take a look at this company on a more macro-economically level, there’s a clear trend that they are becoming increasingly dependent on the sale of electricity their power plants produce. Given the global state, margins are under pressure in the area due to lower demand.  It’s widely believed that electricity consumption will increase with the revival of the global economy after the current COVID-19-crisis.

Looking at the second half of 2020, things are starting to look better for Ormat Technologies. They expect an EBITDA of between $400 and $410 million for the full year ($384 million in 2019). 

The acquisition of a first battery storage asset in California last month underlines their ambitious vision, which is becoming a major player in the renewable energy sector. They also plan to accomplish this through increasing their geothermal portfolio by 2023 and beyond. A recent long-term refinancing enables them to actually achieve this.

Taking everything into account, Ormat Technologies is a solid and sound investment, especially for sustainable investors who dare to look long term. Right now, it’s a purchase-worthy tip for the boring and dull among us (I include myself here).

One more titbit to conclude with: those looking at the presidential elections in the USA, might understand that a possible victory for Joe Biden could be a potential boost for all companies involved in renewable energy. Ormat Technologies: sustainable and long-term, for the boring and dull among us"

I have compared between 3 websites (Yahoofinance, Zacks, Morningstar) and non of them match, in term of raw data.

Ticker BABA (Alibaba so some units are in CNY)

&amp;#x200B;

**Yahoofinance**

Net Income (CNY in Billion): 175.518

Shares outstanding (in Billion): 2.71

EPS (TTM): 3.5??

&amp;#x200B;

**Zacks**

Net Income (USD in Billion): 21.104

Shares outstanding (in Billion): 2.71

EPS (TTM): 7.84??

&amp;#x200B;

**Morningstar**

Net Income (CNY in Billion): 175.518

Shares outstanding (in Billion): 2.672

EPS (TTM): 19.55??

&amp;#x200B;

**My own calculation**

Net Income (CNY in Billion): 175.518 (26.33 USD)

Shares outstanding (in Billion): 2.71

EPS (TTM): 26.33/2.71 = 9.72

Would people just not be buying anything?  Were there any lower priced sub $5 dollar stocks that shot up 10-30% in a day or was that nonexistent?

The market continued their bull run today, finishing modestly up. Major indexes are consolidating recent gains in the wake of a decrease in coronavirus cases, COVID testing developments, and a policy shift by the Federal Reserve. 

The NASDAQ closed 0.51% up. The S&amp;P rose to its fifth record close, ending the day 0.65% up. The Dow also rose today, snapping a recent streak of underperformance. It finished 0.58% up and sits just 1000 points away from February highs. An incredible rum overall in the market for this week.

President Trump announced a $750 million deal with Abbott Laboratories ($ABT) for rapid COVID-19 tests at the Republican National Convention Thursday night. Under the agreement, the administration would purchase 150 million of the tests, which take only 15 minutes to deliver results. The Food and Drug Administration granted Abbott's test emergency use authorization on Wednesday for patients with suspected COVID-19, making it the first rapid coronavirus test that doesn't require any special computer equipment. The test is the size of a credit card and is based on the same technology used to test for the flu, strep throat, and other infections. This new test has been hailed a ‘gamechanger’ by Yahoo Finance.

Meanwhile in Japan, its longest running prime minister resigned for health reasons. Europe continues with its fight to reopen the economies in the midst of the health pandemic. And for the meantime it seems like US and China trade talks are developing positively.

Finally there are very high expectations that we see an official announcement regarding the sale of Tiktok at some point over the weekend.

TikTok is nearing an agreement to sell its U.S., Canadian, Australian and New Zealand operations in a deal that’s likely to be in the $20 billion to $30 billion range, sources say.

3847,1,"Compared to other tech stocks they aren’t growing at all. I am usually very up to take with PC technology anf most of the stocks I’ve been eyeing over the past 5 years have gone up 500%+ (not that surprising in this market but anyway). Qualcomm has not. I recently started a job in the mobile industry and considering how widely used their chips are, it baffles me how they have hardly grown over the past 5 years. They’re up about 100% but compared to other stocks this is not much at all.

Not just mobile either. Qualcomm’s chips are being used in wireless VR as well (Oculus quest...), and I believe as wireless technology advanced their chips will be used in many more ways (think wearables, or smaller devices IoT). 

So I am wondering if anyone knows whats up? How come they aren’t valued any higher? Looking at investing cause I believe their field is gonna be big in the future (5G chips as well), however seems scare that they haven’t grown lately. Is there any other chip manufacturers that they compete with outside of Apple’s? Anyone got some insight on Qualcomm (QCOM)?"

Honestly some of the best financial stats in the entire market right now, yet this thing cant hold a $15 price much less $16. I know they aren't voting shares but it shouldn't make *that* much of a difference. Considering Kroger pulls in about twice the revenue of ACI, that should make Kroger roughly 2x as valuable. At Krogers 27.4b market cap, Albertsons should be 1/2 that, if not more because Albertsons revenue has grown each if the last 4 years while Kroger has not consistently grown year after year. I think ACI should be trading at $25 minimum, $28 fairly valued.

Edit: some seem concerned with the debt. Albertsons purchased Safeway in 2015. At the time, Albertsons was the 3rd largest grocer and Safeway was the 2nd largest. That's an unusual buyout in that the smaller company bought out the big name. It has since cut its debt from 12b to 8b. Maybe it will take another 5 years of debt repayment for investors to get interested. Why is Albertsons (ACI) so underpriced?"

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

My understanding is, that they are still going strong when it comes to being a leading chinese used car website, but they got hit by the trade war fud and at one point they divested from their loan business, basically losing a bunch of revenue.

I'm new to investing and am looking for some insight on when/how investors re-evaluate their positions.

After you've done your research into a company and taken a position, when do you re-evaluate?

My thinking has been that so long as nothing has changed fundamentally about the company, I should continue to hold my positions through both upswings and downswings in market value, with a long term outlook. I'm curious to see if others feel the same, how often you re-evaluate your positions and what exactly you look at. 

My small portfolio is 50% (10) growth stocks, 25% (3) market ETFs and 25% (4) dividend stocks. I expect the growth stocks to need the most frequent attention, whereas my holdings for dividends and ETFs probably won't need much re-evaluation at all. Anyway, thanks for helping this new guy out.

But I don’t really get the idea of the whole ‘priced in’ analogy.

The stock is at where it is now, and who knows, it might be there because people are excited on what’s to come. Let’s pretend it’s at 2200 because of all their future innovations. But what happens when Elon releases FSD, unleashes the robotaxi network, confirms first solid deliveries of the cybertruck and announces the new Roadster, the stock is just going to go up isn’t it..?

Regardless of what event is ‘priced in’, when that big event happens like any of the above, the news will still drive the stock price up, so no, it wasn’t really priced in. I think there’s a distinction between the excitement of something happening (driving price up), and the actually event happening, which will just put it up more.

Boeing (BA) -&gt; scares me at times
Boston Properties (BXP)
Canadian Solar (CSIQ) -&gt; loving this one recently
MMM
ConoccoPhillips (COP) -&gt; freakin oil
Exxon Mobil (XOM) -&gt; freakin oil
Sea Limited (SE)
Shopify (SHOP) -&gt; biggest returner, got back in March at the dip

Is there an obvious industry that I should be aware of and you have no idea why I’m not invested there or something that is slept on?

4783,1,"Motley Fool says it’s not too late to buy into Spotify $SPOT despite its valuation rising to over 5x revenues.  It says Spotify’s total addressable market is 10 times the current number of MAUs, and more than 23 times the number of Premium subscribers, indicating plenty of opportunity ahead. Profitability should improve as growth leads to more negotiating power while recent moves to allow music labels to promote music on its platform and a transition towards podcasts should boost margins. Finally, Spotify’s Premium subscription plan in the U.S. still costs $9.99 -- the same price it launched with in the U.S. in 2011. As the company continues to gain market share and entrenches itself further as the streaming audio leader, it is likely to eventually raise prices.

Benzinga says stock market valuations have hit an all time high according to the “Buffett Indicator”.   The indicator monitors the market capitalization-to-GDP ratio and recently hit 182.7% compared to its historical average between 93% and 114%. Worryingly, the ratio dwarfs historical highs when it peaked at 107.5% at the height of the housing bubble in 2007 and at 139.5% during the dot-com bubble in 2000.

Seeking Alpha reported on Dollar General's $DG strong comparable sales, up 18.8% in Q2, to top the consensus estimates of +14.9%. Same-store sales increased in each of the consumables, seasonal, home products and apparel categories, with the largest percentage increase in the home products category.  Margins were also up due to higher initial markups on inventory purchases, a greater proportion of sales coming from the non-consumables product categories (higher margins) and a reduction in markdowns as a percentage of net sales.  No formal full-year guidance was issued due to the pandemic but EO Todd Vasos was bullish saying ""We continue to operate from a position of strength and are excited to announce the acceleration of several key strategic initiatives, including the rollout of DG Pickup, DG Fresh, and our Non-Consumables initiative, as well as an increase in our expected number of real estate projects for fiscal 2020,"".  Valuation at just 20x current year estimates looks very reasonable.

5265,1,"Hi everybody, I recently did some DD for Siemens as I've been looking into them as a potential purchase before their Siemens Energy Spin-off. I thought it would be good to share and get some feedback/discussion going before Monday for anybody looking to get in last min. I still on the fence about if for reasons I will discuss below. 

Please be aware that I am new to DCF valuation so there could be some errors. I am also typing this out without much planning so my apologies if I repeat myself.

Ticker SIEGY, it is on OTC. Also, keep in mind that the stock is trading 2:1 OTC: Actual. Meaning that every two OTC stocks you own = 1 actual stock. This caused me some confusion at first.

**Siemens Energy Split**

Siemens AG is going to do a 2:1 spin-off of Siemens Energy next Tuesday. Siemens Energy will take over their energy sector while Siemens AG will focus on things like smart infrastructure. Siemens AG will also keep a 30% stake in the renewable sector. The fact that they are keeping this 30% is pretty interesting, it removes the negative PR from gas, but keeps the green positive PR of the renewable within the main company and the sector has seen some growth for a while. Siemens is one of the biggest players in wind energy so I thought they were an interesting play. If they split 100% of the renewable I may have just waited and gone for Energy but keeping this portion makes staying in Siemens AG also an interesting play. This will also allow their energy sector to focus on international expansion more and compete with GE and Japan (especially now that Abe has left). So, with the OTC this means (I believe) that for every 4 OTC shares you will get 1 (or 2 if they also are 2:1) Siemens Energy. Overall, I see the split as a positive and that both sides should gain from this.

**Diversification**

The main reason I started looking at Siemens was that I wanted an established company in the EU. Siemens has been around for a while now, Germany is handling the pandemic fairly well and Siemens also has great exposure to the rising Indian market. Overall their diversification made them a company worth looking at imo.

**Fair Value**

Let me start by saying I am new to using DCF, but in calculating Fair Value I used DCF with a required return of 5% and a very conservative .5% revenue growth over 5 years to get 118Euros without any margin of safety. This is pretty much where the stock is currently sitting. Normally I would like to add at least a 15% margin which would put it down at 100 Euros per share (118USD) or 59USD per OTC share. This would make the stock overvalued. However, with the news of the Siemens Energy Spinoff happening on Tuesday we need to consider that this is priced in. Conglomerates are more difficult to manage and by spinning off Siemens Energy management will be able to focus on their individual needs, and Siemens AG will also lose the attachment to any negative associations that come with gas &amp; climate change. I also figured we have to factor in the main reason for getting into this stock which is diversification; so, keeping this in mind and the conservative numbers used I think the fair value can be kept where it stands. This valuation does not consider Dividends. 

**My Decision (Should I buy)**

I am really on the fence here. I would like to diversify into Europe and especially into India so I think Siemens is a good play for this. However, the valuation isn't anything super special where it stand and I think there is more to be made elsewhere. I will probably keep my eye on it after the split and over the next few years as I think it is a safe stock that people will flee to in hard times. I just don't know enough about their Indian exposure to really gauge their potential growth. I will mull it over on the weekend but I would like to hear some other opinions. Siemens AG (SIEGY) DD &amp; Discussion before Tuesday's Siemens Energy Spin-off."
5266,1,"This thing has been hovering around .07 since June and has a bunch of catalysts approaching which should send it up towards .30 no problem.

Now, it is an OTC stock so keep that in mind...they filed for up listing 4 weeks ago and an insider has mentioned that they expect to be up listed this quarter.

There is an open offering which should close within the next week or two...this alone will send the price up.

Their app release is scheduled for September which will also send the price up...

There are a lot of big names involved in this who work for NFL Network, Ex-ESPN employees, and Ex-CBS Sports Employees so expect some big sponsors to pour in some cash and also look out for advertising on these networks (not confirmed but possible).

This shot up to .28 in May when the website was released for their new app WinQuik...as people thought that the app was releasing during this time.  This is an easy 100-400% play depending on where you get in but anything under a .10 cost basis is basically guaranteed 100% gains.

5269,1,"The world’s most valuable car company just hit another milestone.

Tesla ￼’s (ticker: TSLA) market capitalization on Wednesday topped $400 billion. About two months ago, it was celebrating $200 billion. It first hit $100 billion in January.

Tesla passed Johnson &amp; Johnson ￼ (JNJ) along the way on Wednesday, in terms of market cap. There are only seven companies in the S&amp;P 500 index worth more, including Visa ￼ (V) at $447 billon and Apple ￼ (AAPL) at $2.16 trillion.

There is a lot you could buy for $400 billion. Here are a few notable   comparisons to put that figure in context.

It’s more than the combined value of every team in the four major U.S. professional sports, according to Forbes estimates. It’s also more than the Forbes estimate for the combined net worth of Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and Tesla’s own CEO Elon Musk.

It’s nearly four times International Business Machines ￼’ (IBM) market cap.

You could buy 400 billion things at a dollar store—or just buy Dollar General ￼ (DG) and Dollar Tree ￼ (DLTR).

It’s also more than the individual gross domestic product of Israel, Ireland, and Hong Kong.

With $400 billion, you could also stockpile about 181 billion regular gallons of gas, based on AAA’s U.S. estimates. You could drive 5.79 trillion miles, if you averaged 32 miles per gallon. That would take you around the Earth 232.5 million times.

If you are into electric vehicles, $400 billion could get you 10.53 million of Tesla’s basic 2020 Model 3. Of course, such a sale would cause price targets to soar. And Tesla would need a few more factories to turn out that many vehicles. The company only delivered about 90,000 vehicles in the second quarter.

Link to story is [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jackson-hole-powell-unveils-effort-to-target-moderately-higher-inflation-131005405.html)



&gt;Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell unveiled a new framework of thinking for the central bank that will tolerate inflation “moderately” above its 2% target. The Fed also committed to reviewing this policy every five years.

&gt;In a speech on Thursday morning, Powell acknowledged the painful lessons of runaway inflation in the 1970’s, but warned that the persistence of low inflation over the last eight years risks new economic difficulties. 

&gt;“Many find it counterintuitive that the Fed would want to push up inflation,” Powell said. But the Fed chief warned that low inflation leads to declining inflation expectations, which has the effect of “diminishing our capacity to stabilize the economy through cutting interest rates.”

&gt;The Fed’s target for inflation is 2%, measured as core personal consumption expenditures (which excludes volatile components like energy and food prices). But since establishing that goal in its 2012 Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, the Fed has averaged inflation of only about 1.6%, touching 2% only briefly in 2018.

&gt;In 2019, the Fed launched a nationwide listening tour to see if it could tweak its statement with the objective of nudging inflation up toward its target.

&gt;On Thursday morning, Powell announced the conclusion of that review and said the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee had unanimously approved new language that would allow for inflation moderately above 2% “for some time” following periods where inflation “has been running persistently” below that target. 

&gt;The strategy is known as flexible average inflation targeting, in part because the Fed will not use a particular mathematical formula to define a time horizon over which 2% inflation is achieved.

&gt;“Of course, if excessive inflationary pressures were to build or inflation expectations were to ratchet above levels consistent with our goal, we would not hesitate to act,” Powell said.



&gt;Powell emphasized in his speech that although the major changes address its Congressional mandate on price stability, the Fed still places a heavy priority on its other dual mandate of maximum employment.

&gt;The revised statement now says the Fed’s policy decisions need to be guided by assessments of “the shortfalls of employment from its maximum level.”

&gt;Powell’s remarks, delivered virtually to the Fed’s annual Jackson Hole meeting, describe the change as a reflection of “our view that a robust job market can be sustained without causing an outbreak of inflation.”

&gt;The Fed also added language that commits the FOMC to “use its full range of tools to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.” The statement will now also require the Fed to undertake a “thorough” review of the statement every five years.

1) I set a trailing stop order at about 10-15% drop and sell half of my shares and hold the rest.

5813,1,"This Posts intends to give an overview over RLFTF and it's COVID-19 drug, it is divided in different sections to give a holistic overview over RLFTF. RLFTF is a Drug Development Company registered at the Swiss Stock Exchange RLF.SW and US OTC Ticker RLFTF.

RLFTF's patented drug RLF-100^(TM)(Aviptadil/VIP) has a FDA Fast Track designation and is in two Clinical Trials and a FDA Intermediate Expanded Access Program. Preliminary data show a mortality reduction of over 90% in the most critical COVID-19 ICU Patients.^(3)

**Clinical Data and Mechanism of Action - why this is the best COVID-19 drug.**

RLF-100(Aviptadil/VIP) has a 30 year research history and is already Approved by some Countries for other Indications (UK Approved for Errectile Dysfunction and EU Orphan drug status for Sarcoidosis treatment \*EU designation (EU/3/07/473)), it is already known to be a safe drug with minimal side-effects. ^(5,6)

*Mechanism Of Action*

1. RLF-100 inhibits the SARS-COV-2(COVID19) Virus from replicating itself by blocking the respective receptors. **It is the only known Drug** so far that **prevents the Virus from replicating**(spreading), it act's preventive and not just symptomatic. ^(1)
2. RLF-100 prevents and/or stops the Zytokine Storm, is highly anti-inflamantory and acts on RANTES (CCL5) - in almost the same way that e.g. CYDY's LL drug does.^(2)
3. RLF-100 is a natural peptide produced and used by the body to protect &amp; heal the lung and to improve blood oxygenation. Severe CASES of COVID-19 have shown low levels of exactly this Peptide.^(3)

*Clinical Data*

Currently there are 2 Clinical Trials underway and a FDA Intermediate Expanded Access Program.

1. Phase 2/3 Trial, IV RLF-100 for Critical COVID-19 Patients, Estimated completion in September 2020 [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04311697](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04311697)
2. FDA granted IND for Clinical Trial of RLF-100 in inhaled version with the goal to provide a **preventive treatment at home** to prevent a moderate/severe COVID-19 infection.4 Estimated completion in November [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04360096](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04360096)
3. FDA Intermediate Population Expanded Access of RLF-100, Expanded Access Program for cases too critical to be part of the above studies. In this EAP aims to treat the most critical COVID-19 Patient. [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04453839](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04453839)

All currently available Clinical Data regarding COVID-19 is from the Expanded Access. The first 21 Patients showed a Rapid recovery and a mortality reduction of over 90%. This patients consist out of the worst case COVID-19 cases like patients with combined double lung transplant rejection and severe COVID-19 infections. ^(3)

*Summary:*

RLF-100 blocks the COVID-19 Virus, prevents a zytokine storm, heals the lungs and improves blood oxygenation with a mortality reduction of over 90% in the most severe cases.

*Further possible indications*

Possible further indications for RLF-100 are almost all lung affecting diseases, as RLF-100 protects and heals the lungs.

Further RLF-100 acts on RANTES(CCL5) and could be indicated for treatment of HIV, Cancer and other RANTES specific diseases after further studies.

**Current Demand / Demand for Expanded Access**

\- On behalf of Relief Therapeutics, NeuroRX is currently fielding multiple requests from representatives of health ministries, who would like to access RLF-100 for their countries. ^(7)

\- There is currently a high volume of requests for Expanded Access from US licensed physicians ^(8)

**FDA Fast Track &amp; NeuroRX Partnership**

RLFTF has a FDA Fast Track designation for the RLF-100 Drug 1 all clinical trials and studies are conducted by Relief Therapeutics partner NeuroRX, a privately held US Company. Relief Therapeutics own all rights on RLF-100 and pays NeuroRX to conduct the trials. ^(6)

**Share Price Target**

While it is difficult to determine a Share Price for a Stock which this Potential, my personal calculations put the potential between 5-20$. Analysis see the intermediate Share Price target at 18$ which would be a 3600% increase of the current Price. ^(9)

**Catalysts in the near Future**

1. In the Upcoming Days we expect an announcement of a Partnership with a large drug distribution and logistics Company.
2. A Board member of RLFTF said during an interview that by October they will be ready to deliver treatment to 100'000 patients.
3. Study Results of the Phase 2/3 Study are due in September. Judged by the Expanded Access data, which treats more severe Cases than in the Study, the results are expected to be very good.
4. It is expected that the Data Monitoring Committee might Stop the study and recommend an approval to the FDA, so that Patients from the Placebo control group can be treated as well.

**Stock Exchange, Markets and Regulatory Specifics**

RLFTF is registered as RLF.SW at the Swiss Stock Exchange and is subject to swiss exchange law's and regulations. All Management Transactions and Transactions of Significant Shareholders have to be Published according to the Swiss Exchange Regulations.

Publishing of (Corporate) News is only allowed off Market (at least 90 minutes prior to Market opening) if News is published during the Market hours, trading will be suspended for some time. There is little chance with this stock for a late ""jump-on"" once a big catalyst is released, as it will be off-market.

In the US RLFTF is a OTC Traded Stock. RLFTF just filed a OTCQB Application and will therefor also be regulated by the SEC in the future, though i feel the Swiss Regulation is stricter anyway.

**Information about Market Cap, Outstanding Shares and Expected Earnings.**

There was a very comprehensive interview by a Swiss Investment Newspaper covering the Above topics, please check out [https://themarket.ch/interview/relief-therapeutics-our-drug-could-generate-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars-per-year-ld.2478](https://themarket.ch/interview/relief-therapeutics-our-drug-could-generate-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars-per-year-ld.2478) , it contains almost everything we want to know at this Point.

**Disclaimer**

I follow the clinical development of RLF-100 since the outbreak of SARS-COV-2 and i'm invested since early spring, i see myself as a long term investor. My primary investment motivation is that, after extensive research over months, i believe in the potential of this drug. Please do your own due diligence prior to investment and let me know if you would like to have more information included in this Post, i'll try to update it accordingly.

5815,1,"Is anyone following Coty Cosmetics?  I'm relatively new at investing (started around covid-peak) and somewhat familiar with the cosmetics industry.  It scares me that they are on their 5th CEO in 5 years, but the parent company JAB Holdings looks like they might put 750 mil back into the company to stimulate growth.  The new CEO Sue Nabi has been in the industry for a long time, and had created her own prestige skincare brand.  I'm curious to see if she's going to try to embrace the small size of Coty instead of fighting against it.  The company's been throwing around a lot of money the past couple years.   


I saw some stuff today saying they might be closing down some plants.  


They posted a 1.2Bil drop in sales YoY yesterday.  The stock has been taking a hammering the past two days and it's around $3.55.  They've got some deals with the Kardashians in the works, but who knows how long that will take.

I'll share a few that interest me (yet to purchase):  

SAE (germany): Online pharmacy retailer that has benefited due to the shift to online sales. I think there is long-term potential because the German govt has mandated that by 2022 e-prescriptions are obligatory from insurers/physicians, and SAE is well positioned to take advantage of that.    

Hello fresh (germany):  Huge YoY increase in subscribers, move into profit, although i am doubtful whether demand will remain post-virus?    

Vestas wind (denmark):  Wind turbine company. Great YoY growth and a steady stream of orders hitting the news. Margin fell due to ""one-off"" 170mil euro repair bill which I would like to know more about before investing.   

ASML (holland): manufactures optics required for microchip production. I am already in Taiwan Semi so perhaps not a good choice, but growth prospects look excellent.  

Ayden (holland): I only noticed this today and it seems similar to Square. At 1500 euros perhaps too late? Somehow in the UK I have never heard of it before.  

 

Would be glad to hear any others even if it is just tickers. No FTSE please :) Lets share european growth stock ideas?"

So i have sold many calls/puts in the past but I was wondering about using margin (i know it's risky). So i have about 94 shares of SPYG. I would like to sell calls on that. Say instead of buying the 6 remaining shares, i used margin. Can i sell one contract and have the remaining leverage covered by margin?

It still has that great dividend but month over month, year over year it's value has been dropping, and it has been loosing space to other telecom companies like Version. There has been major criticism of the company as a whole ([Open Letter From Elliott Management to AT&amp;T](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190909005482/en/Elliott-Management-Sends-Letter-Board-Directors-ATT)) including its missed opportunities and how it was managed.

Among 18 to 24 year-olds, only 17% use Microsoft-owned LinkedIn. For TikTok, that number is more than double at 42%. Only Instagram (82%), Twitter (46%), and Facebook (46%) have a greater reach with young adults.

Around 90% of Microsoft’s $1.6 trillion current valuation can be attributed to its enterprise cloud strategy, including Azure and Office 365, according to Wedbush. Acquiring TikTok would help Microsoft diversify its business and find new areas for growth.

I am a college student and in a school investment group where I work in the energy sector and I have been screening for stocks to pitch / model for the semester. 

I really like the company's technology however I wonder if it is one of those companies where the technology just doesn't catch on and become mainstream and it will just fade over time. It seems as solar is an area where many investors are flocking to in energy as oil &amp; gas has been hit hard due to the pandemic's effect on demand, the rise of oil inventories &amp; geopolitical tensions earlier in the year.  I just don't foresee a future in which pitching an oil and gas company goes well. As for BE, looking through the financials obviously they are an unprofitable company currently, revenues have been stagnant/declining YoY for roughly a year-2 now. On the bright side, with the deal they announced last month partnering with the SK group it gives me hope that over time the technology will be adopted over time driving revenues.  

Overall, I'm curious for some insight from investors or anyone who has first-hand knowledge in the energy sector on their technology or just the industry in general Thoughts on Bloom Energy (BE)?"

CCH/UTZ Merger"
6940,1," 

I've been trying to understand the correlation between the bonds, currency, and stocks to determine what the macro outlook might be for the remainder of the year through 2021-2022. With Chairman Powell doubling down on the FEDs desire to maintain an average 2% inflation target (mind you this has never been achieved consistently) wouldn't this put selling pressure in the secondary bond market as bondholders seek yields? A selloff in bonds would inherently cause a rise in yields, forcing future bond auctions to raise yields to attract new investors. These higher yields would, in turn, cause an influx of domestic and foreign money into the higher-yielding bonds, causing a short squeeze of the USD. Or would money start to flow to emerging markets? I think that an uncontrollable rise in yields would be bullish for the dollar despite the FEDs dovish policy, partly because of the demand for dollars spurred by rising yields, but also because of the dollar's position as the world's reserve currency. The uncontrollable rising of yields would cause a dollar demand and another liquidity crisis, despite the massive printing via purchases. To be clear, the FED would not be able to purchase notes once a bond sell-off occurs without being forced to auction off new notes at higher rates. This would happen when there is no one left to sell. (i.e. everyone is in the pool, whether it be equities or emerging markets, at which point, no one is left to buy. With no buyer to push price higher, the market will fall, and abruptly.)

I need to bounce these ideas off of something and had no one to share it with. Some discussion would be nice. Bond Crash and Dollar Squeeze"
6941,1,"We are in one of the craziest markets of history. Large stocks get larger, small stocks get smaller, and a lot of stocks are in-between.

Here what's happening, and what is going to happen.

The stock market is not all green. Pandemic-infected stocks (cruise lines, air lines, etc.) are struggling. Pandemic-supported stocks (big tech) are thriving. Then there's la-la land, the stocks that aren't suffering but aren't booming (most banks, coca cola, etc.). So what's going on?

With so much extra stimulus and savings account deemed useless due to low interest rates, stocks have the most upside. There's gotta be a crash soon, right? Wrong. At least not for the next few months. The stock market pre-pandemic was BOOMING. If the pandemic never hit, the market would have continued to boom. Although unemployment is still high, those who have been fortunate enough to keep their jobs have gotten extra stimulus, and nothing to do but sit at home and invest. It's the take of 2 economies, some are suffering, some are profiting. 

Realistically, if the pandemic never hit, the stock market would have continued to boom right up until the election, would have had a small pull back, then continued upward. So what will happen? Come the election, depending on the result, the market may ""pause"" for a second. The real kicker will be the economy post-vaccine. Currently, the market is being held by the Fed, as well as future hopes. Investors believe once a vaccine is available, the economy will pick up where it left off and boom. But what if it doesn't? With so many businesses closing, even with a vaccine, the unemployment rate will stay relatively high. With a vaccine, the stimulus will most likely stop. No stimulus in conjunction with a high unemployment will hault retail sales. With a vaccine, mortgage rates will start to creep back up, with will hurt the housing market. Once a vaccine is available, if the economy doesn't bounce back instantly, you'll see the market react. That, mixed with the election, is when a crash will occur.

So enjoy the gains. We have another 3-4 months of strong solid gains. Invest, make money, then come November/December pull your money and sit on it. A trip into the future, the stock market. You're welcome."

For those not familiar, basically you're taking w.e you receive in premium  and dividends and buying additional shares. If you have extra cash on hand, then you're using accumulate a larger amount of shares at a small discount. For example, collecting $600 , you'll buy 3 additional shares, which are now discounted by 50%. So in the event of a crash, these 3 shares are at a no loss. 

Risks are still the same, which are crashes, opportunity costs, etc. 

Seems like this is the best way for compounding interest in your buy and hold strategy, especially if you have regular income coming in to add to these positions.

so I was just wondering if any of you guys use different brokerages for your long-term and for your short-term investments? How could I go about doing this if this is what most people do?

7529,1,"So I’ve been heavily invested in Nio for a while now. So much so that every cent their share price moves, I gain or lose about $1. That being said I’ve effectively lost over $250 of my gains by sitting on them and hoping for more. My question is, how do I know the best time to sell?

I’m fairly new to investing so I’m still learning. From what I understand, my strategy is pretty much swing trading as I buy shares and hold them for a few weeks before taking a profit (if any). But I’ve been bitten before now by holding on for too long and losing $500, so I’m looking to avoid that again. 

I pretty much predicted that Nio might drop like this again but I held out for fear of it climbing higher without me, but now I’m worried that I’ll just have a repeat of the last time I lost money. 

I know there’s no crystal ball that can tell you the answer otherwise everyone would be retired by now, but if anyone can give me some advice I’d really appreciate it. I just feel like there must be some way to predict the market. For instance, is there always a dip immediately after a spike like what Nio is doing now? How much does this dip tend drop by? When will it start to rise again? Cold feet as Nio drops to $18.02 in the after market"

Takeoff: tomorrow @JPowell Speech

Moon: Sept 2nd earnings 

Mars: when ratings are released by the major firms for RKT

Beyond: Dan Gilbert keeps being Dan Gilbert.
Edit: my reasoning \/

TLDR at end.
Speech: long term low-interest rates will boost the housing market. 

Earnings &amp; Ratings: although RKT has given us a peek at Q2 earnings, nothing is ‘official’ yet. Having official earnings and projections will encourage investors (not traders, but long term IRA, funds, etc.). Especially after the major firms release ratings (good).

Beyond: Dan Gilbert has done very well thus far. And by just looking at one example (a very small sample size, but this gets the point across), we can see that RKT is fundamentally undervalued. RKT has 76 times more profits than TREE. When comparing their value to RKT, RKT should be 5x more valuable. And this isn’t even getting into RKT Price/earnings (8.63), Forward Price/Earnings (6.19), or even their PEG.  

This isn’t to mention that RKT isn’t considered a ‘fintech’ when they are wayyy ahead of other mortgage lenders considerably on the technological front. I know a mortgage lender at one of the “big banks,” and even says himself RKT is the future and banks consider them a threat. 

TLDR; RKT is undervalued, and it’s just waiting for people to realize/verify it.

*But if the index is below the average, don’t think, just sell. And don’t buy back until it gets back above the average again*""

8802,1,"I want to start out by saying I am not here to discuss anything about general politics or pick sides. I am not from the United States and have no ties to the elections nor do I have any willingness to discuss it outside of how it affects the uranium sector and nuclear power as a whole. In accordance to the rules of this subreddit, I want to ask you all to do the same and only focus on the investment side of things. With that out of the way, let's get on with why I wrote this thing in the first place.

Another week, another reason to bring you all an update on my extensively discussed and occasionally hated uranium thesis. This time I want to discuss a much asked question, which is what the US elections will mean for the uranium bull case. But before I do, please also read my previous posts on the uranium market. I have answered hundreds of questions regarding my investment thesis and you are sure to find an answer to your question there. Now, about that upcoming election.

The US elections will no doubt have a significant effect on the stock market as a whole, whether that will be good or bad remains to be seen. What we do know however, is that both Trump and Biden have publicly announced their support of nuclear power. As they both know that renewables in all forms cannot help the US meet its climate goals or energy output without nuclear power, which is further expanded upon in this article.
https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/we-cant-solve-climate-change-without-nuclear-power/

Biden is pro nuclear and has publicly [stated](https://www.isidewith.com/candidates/joe-biden-2/policies/science/nuclear-energy) that and so [has](https://www.isidewith.com/candidates/donald-trump/policies/science/nuclear-energy) Trump, although he has added ""as long as there is no public subsidy.

Let's start with the current president, Donald Trump. He has stated to be [in support](https://www.google.com/amp/s/insideclimatenews.org/news/24042020/trump-nuclear-uranium-mining-grand-canyon-coronavirus%3famp) of nuclear power and has penned a deal where he committed 150 million dollars a year for 10 years to build up a US uranium reserve. He also wants to restore the 'US nuclear advantage' by helping the few US uranium miners that are left to start production again. The vast majority of this capital would go to the two biggest uranium miners in the country, with the rest going to the smaller ones. US uranium production is at a multi decade low, but there looks to be light at the end of the tunnel of them if/when this legislation finally gets into effect next year.


So while Trump pledges to help the miners with and capital to build a reserve, what does opponent Joe Biden plan to do? Well Biden [has pledged](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2020/08/17/what-will-a-biden-harris-administration-do-for-nuclear-energy/amp/?__twitter_impression=true) to a 2 trillion dollar climate plan as part of his plan to get back into the Paris agreement. This enormous plan includes the support of nuclear power and he has publicly voiced his support for nuclear power generation, as he knows that without extensive use of green baseload nuclear energy the climate goals cannot be met. 

He has also been very [supportive](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/14/1005197/biden-steps-up-his-clean-energy-plan-in-a-nod-to-climate-activists/amp/) of the expanding of SMR technology and the building of these small modular reactors to better take advantage of nuclear power on a relatively smaller scale as opposed to the more traditional nuclear reactors that today provide around 20% of all power generation in the US.

So what does this all mean for the uranium bull case that I have been describing in several posts before this? It means that the US elections, no matter which way it might swing, will not have a significant effect on the global uranium sector other than a possible general market down or upturn. Both Trump and Biden have voiced their support on nuclear power and pledged to help the sector, which also includes the few US uranium miners that are left.

But it doesn't only affect them, it also affects miners based in Canada and Australia for example, since the US cannot produce all the millions of pounds of uranium needed to power their nuclear fleet and needs to import large amounts in order to keep the lights on. With the US being by far the largest user of nuclear power in the world, them expanding on their nuclear fleet and using more and more of this green baseload power will ultimately only strengthen this uranium bull case as demand keeps growing and the [supply deficit ](https://www.cameco.com/invest/markets/supply-demand) keeps getting bigger as well.


This simply means one of two things. Either we find a way to make nuclear fusion work on a global scale within the next two years or the price of uranium goes up exponentially to incentivize the mining of uranium and exploration for new uranium deposits, because we [absolutely need it](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2016/09/f33/27%2520-%2520Comment%2520from%2520Uranium%2520Producers%2520of%2520America%2520%2528UPA%2529.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjVnZbGp6TrAhWSsaQKHTNDDkYQFjACegQIChAH&amp;usg=AOvVaw0_YVtv2ywqJw7XPtteGVOc) to meet the proposed climate goals. With the average price to mine uranium standing at around $67.10, the current price needs to at the very least double to get things moving again.

Also before you ask, no, the US is definitely not the only place which needs nuclear power to fight global warming, [European countries](https://euro-babble.eu/2019/11/20/countdown-2050-eu-cannot-achieve-climate-goals-without-nuclear-energy/) need it just as much, as stated here.

As you can see, we need these things together and not against each other and we need a significant increase in both to meet the proposed climate goals.

To me it is clear where this thing is going and although I most definitely do not expect a bull market that will run for a decade, I do expect it to really start somewhere within the next year and last until the price stays above 50-70 (which could also go much higher, but nobody knows that) dollars for a significant amount of time and utilities are done signing new long term contracts in order to fuel their power plants. Remember that if someone is tasked with supplying fuel for the plant signs a contract paying perhaps a triple digit price per pound for uranium he will not get fired, because it is only roughly 5% of the total cost of running the plant. He will however get fired if he doesn't secure a contract in time and the plant does not have fuel secured. With 40% of all utilities out of contract in 2021 and a further 80% between 2022 and 2023 I expect this to last at least until we reach 2024 or 2025, after which this market will come back down just like every cyclical industry. The macro picture is set and the future outlook is clear, all we need now is the start shot to get this market underway, in whatever form that might manifest itself.

TLDR:
The US elections, no matter who wins, won't have a significant effect on the global uranium sector and would change nothing about the bull case. I hope this helps people invested in the sector sleep a little better around the time of the election.

Disclaimer 1:
Uranium consists of around 25% of my total portfolio. Why not more if I am so convinced? Because I refuse to have something, anything, to be holding more than a fourth of my portfolio no matter how bullish I am.

8804,1,"**Trump or Biden? These ETFs Should Climb Either Way**

The 2020 presidential election is only three months away, and the policy leanings of both candidates have started to come clear. A victory for Democratic challenger Joe Biden or the re-election of President Donald Trump could have implications for a variety of sectors and stocks. Investors should start positioning themselves for either outcome -- or even better, both.

Climate change and energy policy is one of Biden's priority issues. He has announced plans to invest heavily in research and innovation, and aims for a 100% clean energy U.S. economy by 2050. If the Democrats win the White House and Congress, Wolfe Research strategist Chris Senyek expects aggressive environmental legislation to pass, including strong emissions standards across several industries, new fuel-economy standards, mandated future levels of clean-energy production, and a ""cap and trade"" program.

That's great for clean-energy stocks, but the group should be positioned to deliver strong returns even without a Biden win. ""Clean-energy stock prices used to ebb and flow with political winds based on whether they'll be subsidized and supported or not. That has pretty much evaporated"" as the industry has matured, says Jason Bloom, director of global exchange-traded fund strategy and research at Invesco.

Many companies have finally turned profitable over the past two to three years, Bloom says, and their stock performance is now more about fundamentals than the macro backdrop. Public support for sustainable investing has also picked up, pushing much of the private sector to roll out decarbonization plans even absent government regulation. Friendly policies, of course, would offer additional tailwinds, but won't be as determinative on the clean-energy industry as they were 10 years ago.

The $344 million First Trust Nasdaq Clean Edge Green Energy ETF (QCLN), and the $484 million Invesco WilderHill Clean Energy ETF (PBW) offer diversified exposure to stocks in areas like renewable energy, electric cars, battery technology, and biofuels. Both funds have track records of more than 10 years, have returned an annualized 18% over the past five years, and gained 50% and 48%, respectively, in 2020 alone. They are quite concentrated, owning just about 40 stocks. The Invesco WilderHill ETF is equal weighted, and hence tilts more toward smaller, cheaper stocks. The First Trust ETF, on the other hand, assigns heavier weights to larger stocks like Tesla (TSLA) and NIO (NIO), which have soared 544% and 352%, respectively, over the past year.

Investors who want a more targeted focus can also look into the $975 million Invesco Solar (TAN), the $144 million First Trust Global Wind Energy (FAN), and the $694 million Global X Lithium &amp; Battery Tech (LIT). All three own international stocks and investors should be aware of currency risks.

Another relatively safe bet, regardless of who wins the White House, is infrastructure companies. The Biden campaign has promised to revitalize U.S. infrastructure, spending $1.3 trillion over a 10-year period on highways, bridges, and airports. Trump is reportedly considering proposing $1 trillion in infrastructure spending.

While there are a dozen ETFs in infrastructure-related stocks, only two are solely dedicated to U.S. companies -- the $213 million Global X US Infrastructure Development ETF (PAVE) and the $16 million iShares U.S. Infrastructure ETF (IFRA). The Global X fund is purely focused on industrial and materials stocks, while the iShares ETF also owns a slew of utility companies.

Still, while infrastructure appears to be something that both candidates want, Senyek warns that it has been talked about for several years without result. ""In our view, neither party wants to allow the other to receive credit for finally passing a package that majorities in both parties favor,"" he says. Senate Republicans, particularly, have been reluctant to get on board, concerned about the mounting federal debt amid coronavirus stimuli. A Democratic sweep would make a large-scale infrastructure bill more likely to pass.

Biden wants to build the American health-care system on the Obama administration's Affordable Care Act. This could benefit the established managed-care giants as more Americans obtain health insurance. There's one catch, though: Biden also wants to create a public option on the ACA exchange, a move that would bring some headwinds for the private sector.

Additionally, both candidates are pushing to cut prescription-drug prices and promote the development of generic drugs. That would be bad news for Big Pharma and biotech, but could reduce expenses for hospitals and health insurers. Investors can own these stocks through the $989 million iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers (IHF) and $95 million SPDR S&amp;P Health Care Services (XHS).

Trump has championed the idea of bringing offshore businesses back to the U.S. from countries like China. A Biden presidency might be more moderate on Beijing, but the decoupling of the countries' economies seems unavoidable. The Biden campaign has promised a future that is ""made in all of America"" by all-U.S. workers, and that would bring back the supply chains across a range of critical products ""on which the U.S. is dangerously dependent on foreign suppliers."" The trend could lift some domestic firms that have been losing business to outsourcing, says Invesco senior equity strategist Nick Kalivas. The $39 million Invesco S&amp;P SmallCap Industrials (PSCI) -- which owns nearly 100 small industrial companies -- could be a good play on the theme.

2,0,"Hello everyone, first time poster here. I'm looking to get into REI and saw an idea shared in a FB group. Just wanting to get some feedback from the people in here who may be more knowledgeable. It goes like this..

Buy a piece of land to use as a campground. Ideally near some larger wood state land. Near me (upstate NY) you can get a few acres for around $15k. Turn it into a campsite. Maybe install an electrical hookup for RV's and an outhouse. I think I would also throw a Yurt on it (another $15k). Put the property on Airbnb, VRBO, and Himpcamp. With the Yurt, you're probably looking at $75-100/night. If you can get a 50% occupancy (I don't have any Airbnb experience but have heard that's a decent baseline estimate), that's around $15k annually in revenue. So after a few years, theoretically you've made your money back (I know there are taxes and fees I'm not accounting for here, I'm just kinda using rough ball-park numbers).

My question(s) for this group.. has anyone heard of this strategy, or even tried it? It sounds like a decent low-cost way to get into rental properties.. what am I not accounting for? Unconventional idea feedback: Investing in Small Campgrounds?"
3,0,"I know this question gets asked a lot, but I'll dive into my specific plan and would love for you all to poke holes in it. 

With the current market the way it is right now, I am looking for unconventional ways to make money in real estate. As a first time investor, I don't feel comfortable buying at the current prices and am looking for cash flow. 

My idea is to buy land in Joshua Tree, a popular camping site in Southern California (which in my opinion is only getting more popular). I can probably get a couple acres for 20k. Then I would get a pre-fab home, something like Boxabl ([https://www.boxabl.com/](https://www.boxabl.com/)) for 50k, and plot it on the land. Then I would list the property on AirBnB and hopefully cash flow.

I understand that plumbing and electricity are common issues with pre-fab homes, so I was wondering how much that would cost to get that installed in a camping location like Joshua Tree. Could I just get a generator? Also, for a property manager I would have to find someone to come and clean the place but that might be hard in the middle of no-where.

Lastly, I have no idea how to predict earnings. How do I estimate how often it would be rented? That could be anywhere from 5% to 95% -- is there a way to safely determine that? Has anyone had experience with buying land and plotting a pre-fab home on it? If so, what were your specific struggles?"

I am a relative newbie still in the education phase but plan to do my first deal within the next few months. I have heard several people recommend using a separate bank account for their investment properties to make the money easier to track. 

A couple questions about this and seeking some advice.

I have a routing number/account number, they sent me a debit card, I can do transfers in and out... but they don't do physical check books.  Can I use this ? or do I need to go with a more traditional checking account ?
2. In the future as I add more properties would you open up a different checking account for each property? or use one for all of your investment properties?

If I wanted to purchase a home that costs $1500 a month which is 45% of my take home but I'll be renting out a portion of the house taking home at least $500 dollars in rental income a month most likely more. This brings my out of pocket to $1000 or less a month and I have the opportunity to build equity faster.

19,0,"I am a very new landlord of a two unit building, one main floor unit and one upper floor unit. They were both heated by a single natural gas forced air furnace. 

My intention was to convert the main floor unit to fully electric baseboard heating, and keep the natural gas furnace heating the upper unit. This is because, where I am from, you are not supposed to have shared air flow between two units.

I received advice from two HVAC technicians to perform this by: adding baseboard heating to main floor unit, and ""cut off the leads"" leading to the main floor unit so they do not get any forced air from the furnace. 

I have now added the baseboard electric heating to the main floor unit. I was about to cut of the leads to this unit, when a friend informed me that by doing so, I will overwork the furnace (which was intended for two units, not one), crack the heat exchanger, and cause carbon monoxide to flow through both units. Now, I have electric heat AND gas forced heat in one unit, and gas heat in the other.

The safety of my tenants is my utmost priority. I am the first in my family to own any property so I am not quite sure who to ask and how to proceed. Is cutting or blocking off leads to one unit, when the furnace was intended for two ever okay? Any advice or recommendations on how to proceed would be hugely appreciated.

So we already all know that lower interest rates drives up house prices because people can afford more mortgage, and thus more house.

But I was curious as to exactly how much (for my rental property). So I made a little chart linked above, with round numbers for illustrative purposes.

So let's say you bought a place 2 years ago for $250k, 10% down, at the prevailing interest rate in 2018 (4.5%), 30 year term. You'll see on the left side I've pulled out some rudimentary assumptions:

* Property Tax = 1%
* Insurance = House Value x 0.0018 + 660
* PMI 0.8%
* DTI 43%, with about $1k of misc other debts (credit card, car, maybe a little student loan). Average credit card debt in the US is over $6k, and average car payments are $300-600 a month, so $1k is ballpark.
* Then I'm assuming 2.5% income increase per year, or roughly inflation.

So for our sample property we start at the 4.5% row and go to the right until we hit the orange, then look up at the column header. That's how much house one could afford with the assumptions above in 2018. **$250k house.**

Then we switch to the 3.0% row (FMAC-reported 07/20 interest rate) and go to the right until we hit the blue. **$310k house.**

When I punch in the actual numbers from my investment property, I find that the second value is almost 100% spot on for the current selling comps.

This means that there is a good chance that my house's price increase is completely explained by:

* Income Increasing
* Interest Rate Decreasing

(At least for my area), that means I can forget all the other explanations I've heard....COVID behavior, cost of materials, etc.

55,0,"Hi all,

Manhattan real estate has been in decline for the past few years pre-covid and is now seeing even sharper declines as many leave the city during the pandemic.

I am thinking the next few months may be my opportunity to fulfill a lifelong dream of owning in the city—a small studio or one bedroom in $600-750K range.

My intention is to use it as a primary residence for at least a few years.  One key factor is to find an HOA that allows short-term leases, as being able to AirBnB the property is part of the long-term plan.

What factors would you consider in timing this decision?  Any pitfalls I should be aware of?  Any advice from more experienced folks here would be massively appreciated. Buying a condo in NYC, considerations?"
56,0,"So I have my eye on a piece of land in a desirable location. It's a popular area for weekend trips, Airbnbs, etc. 

I have enough cash to buy the land, with a bit left over, so I want to build a shipping container home on it. It wouldn't be the only shipping container home in the area. 

I'm sure I could take a personal loan to cover the cost of converting the shipping container into a home.

Once that's done, I want to try and get a mortgage on the house and use it to pay off the loan. The rest of the cash I'll use for other investments nearby. I plan on living in the home I've built, so I can be nearby my other projects. 

My concern is that lenders might be weary of offering a mortgage on a container home. Does anybody have experience with this? 

Also, I'm afraid the personal loan will work against me in getting the mortgage. It will be like $20k, and I don't have any other debt.

61,0,"I have a somewhat complex scenario. I'm not sure which situations will apply or not so I'll just paint the entire picture and see if you can help me sort through.

1. We have sold our primary home and should net around $260,000 in equity So I'll have $260,000 in cash. Closing date is October 9th.

We will be essentially homeless for a period of time while we figure out our options. I will be borrowing a motorhome to live in for a little bit while we remodel a rental house that I will discuss further below. 

2. I have purchased a property that has 2 structures. One of the structures is a remodeled garage that the current owner converted into living space and he currently resides there. 

The other structure is a three bay shop that the guy was using as a supplemental income doing mechanic work. He is trying to get disability because he can only work a few hours a day at most and is in considerable pain all of the time and wants to just simply sell the property and retire. 

My immediate plans for this property would be at closing, gut the living space and remodel it. living it until we figure out what we want to do and then use it as a rental property.

since we are going to be living in a motorhome while this is being remodeled we would then move into that living space until we find a suitable acreage to build upon. This could take week s to find suitable land it could take months or it could take a year or two. And then of course we would have to build upon it. There is a chance we could find something suitable to move right into but I really am not sure if that is something we would be comfortable doing. We kind of want our own thing.therefore we'll probably be living here for at least a few months possibly a year.

We are set to close any day on this shop and living quarters. Just waiting on the abstract and title opinion etc.

But, I'm thinking maybe item number three below could factor into this situation tax purpose-wise.


2. I own an acreage that I paid $50,000 for in November of 2019. (Building on this property is almost 100% not an option due to the distance as it is the opposite direction from my wife's work.)

 I paid cash for it with no loan against it.  

I just eceived an offer for $150,000 for the acreage.

They want to buy it on contract with $40,000 in cash down and then make payments of two or $3,000 a month until it's paid off. They're not opposed to going to get a loan but figured this would be the quickest way to get it done and it might benefit me more to do it this way.

I'm considering it and figuring out what the best options are on it. There is a ton of flexibility here as the buyers are willing to be extremely flexible because they desperately want this property. I don't blame them it is awesome. I just wish it was closer to where we want to be.

So, my question is, what would be The best way to structure the sale of the acreage so has to minimize taxes.

Would it be advisable to do a 1031 exchange with the shop / apartment?

If so, exactly how would that work? About to be homeless. Selling our home and a separate acreage but buying a rental property that I may live in for a brief time. Possible 10:31 exchange?"

This investment is currently in it's planning stages with the involved people saving up over the next 24 months to purchase a property. Our goal is to lessen the impact of our first property purchase as well as divide the work between a total of 3 people.

We also plan to manage the property ourselves, avoiding property managers until we actually need them. We've agreed that doing it ourselves is going to be invaluable experience for when we expand and purchase additional properties.

Some questions i have are:

- Should we form an LLC and buy the property as members with shared ownership? We plan to eventually move to an LLC or something else eventually anyway. 

- Would you recommend something aside from an LLC?

- Most homes in the areas near us (Northern Indiana) are low-cost, ranging from 50k- 250k. Sadly, people don't take care of the properties and some work is guaranteed to be needed (unless going for homes at 130k+) Would it perhaps be a better idea to get a pre-approval from a bank and build a duplex/triplex?

69,0,"Not sure if this is the best sub to post this in--if someone thinks somewhere else would be more appropriate please let me know. This sub was the first that came to mind as far as finding some people who might have similar circumstances.

A family (parent + 3 children) owns four SFH rental properties with the following ownership interests for each property:

parent: 1/2 interest

child 1: 1/6 interest

child 2: 1/6 interest

child 3: 1/6 interest

Properties are not in an LLC.

A loan exists for one of the properties (the loan is in the name of a deceased borrower). Loan balance is $117k and property is worth approximately $450k. The family wishes to do a cash out refinance (up to hopefully 75% LTV = $220k additional cash out) in order to 1) lock in a lower interest rate and 2) get cash to invest, probably in more real estate. 

The long term goal is to grow the family's portfolio while trying to minimize the parent's net worth (in order to minimize / avoid estate tax down the road). Bonus if this can be achieved without major headaches related to taxes and accounting.

Who should apply for the loan? The parent has the greatest income. I don't think any of the children would qualify by themselves. Putting all four individuals on the loan seems like it could be a real hassle as far as the application goes, but it might keep accounting and taxes simpler in the long run. Currently, for accounting and tax purposes, all rental income and expenses are divided according to the interest described above, which keeps things simple. 

And in case anyone can answer a related tax question: if the cash obtained via the cash out isn't immediately used for funding more rental real estate, does that significantly complicate how the interest and the points apportioned to the cash out can be deducted in the future?

72,0,"TL;DR at the bottom.

I've never experienced this situation before.  The background information is one of my buildings is a 6-unit apartment building in a solid B class suburb of a mid-western city.  It's been a pretty good investment since I've had it and overall I'm quite happy with it.  In this area the owner (me) pays for trash services and water/sewer.  Tenants pay electric and gas.  My trash service was set up through a sales rep for the area who set me up with a contract and basically I call her directly if I need anything.  She has been great and when my contract expired after two years and the company started raising my rates every month.  I called her after the price went up 20% and she reset a new contract back at the rate I was at previously.  The building has 4 trash totes and 1 recycle tote, and is 6 smaller units.  I use a PM and have never directly interacted with any tenant.

Background data out of the way, here's what happened.  Last week I got an automated email from my bank that my auto bill pay for the trash at this location was rejected by the bank for exceeding the upper limit amount I had specified.  I set all my owner paid stuff up to auto pay but use some limiters to catch when things go horribly wrong.  The normal bill is $105 but my upper limit was $300.  The bill was for about $310.  Shortly after the email from the bank I get a similar notice from the trash company basically telling me the same thing.  I called my sales rep at the trash company and she digs into the account and says ""What did the call center say when you called them and added the two additional totes?""  I say some version of ""WTF?  I didn't do that.""  The rest of the day was a bit of phone tag as she dug into the account to try and figure out what happened, I called my PM to see if they had made a change on my behalf.  I didn't remember giving them permission to change things, but I couldn't 100% rule it out that maybe I forgot.  Ultimately, I discovered the PM did not make any changes, and the trash provider's notes said the caller said their name was ""Invest-O-Tron-3000"" (my actual name) and a phone number was logged that was NOT my phone number and I didn't recognize.  I assured her it wasn't me since I would have called her directly not to the company's 1-800 line.

At this point I had the thought to check the phone number the call came from (thank goodness they had that logged) against all of my old and current tenant leases to see if it was a current tenant or disgruntled former tenant or something.  I found that it matched one of the tenants currently living in that building.  She is one of the newer tenants maybe 6 months or so.  My PM gets back to me and plays detective going through all their email / phone conversation logs with the tenants in the building and we piece together basically that a couple of the newer tenants in the building (maybe others are involved too but two that I know of for sure) have had a bit of a spat over the trash bins, because one of them is on business travel most of the time and only is home a day here or there, and she says the people in this other unit use too much of the bin space and its sometimes full when she gets home and blah blah blah.

At this point it's fairly clear that there has been some drama between two or more tenants about who is generating more than their fair share of trash, and instead of reaching out to the PM who would then consult with me, one of the tenants, possibly in collaboration with the other or perhaps on her own, called the 1-800 phone number for the trash company, gave them my name (which she would have had to look up through property ownership records as they are never given my name), the trash company call center has no safeguards in place to prevent such a situation, and requested two additional bins.  Because this call went to the call center, it voided me out of my contract, and jacked my rate from my good sales-rep rate to ""full retail pricing"" on all my bins and I get a triple size bill, including ""delivery fees"" for adding the bins.

The sales rep is going to get back with me Monday or Tuesday with options, which could range from removing the two extra bins (which incurs another charge), leaving things as-is, or converting to some other solution entirely like one large dumpster (which has other issues like people doing weekend moves pulling up and unloading their pickup truck beds into it.)

I'm pretty sure that I can ultimately get the trash company to either wave all the unauthorized charges, or take it out of the tenant's account, so in the end I believe I can be made mostly whole.  I wouldn't even have been opposed to re-evaluating the trash bin situation if it had been handled properly instead of people forging my identity and all of that.

I'm not sure how hard I should come down on the tenant.  One one hand tenants are often dumb, and basically need their hands smacked when they do something wrong in order to be retrained.  But I also don't want to reward bad behavior and encourage this sort of thing.  My gut reaction is something like sent general email to all tenants and have PM specifically speak to this tenant with stern ""this is your one allowed screw up"" warning, make her pay for any charges / increases I can't get reimbursed for, and move on with life.  I don't personally feel like it's worth a turnover if I can get paid back, but maybe that's wishful thinking and this is a bad omen of things to come.

TL;DR - One of my tenants who was unhappy about the # trash bins at the building, called the trash company pretending to be me, and ordered more bins, which screwed up my contract and jacked up my bill 300%.  While I work on getting unauthorized changes undone and paid back for their costs, I'm debating how draconian to be with the tenant who did this.

Edit #1 - This literally just happened Friday so I haven’t even found out for example if the trash company can get a recording of the call or not.

Edit #2 - I feel bad saying this but I watered down what I said about my gut reaction.  My true first gut reaction was to show no mercy.  But my first reaction is often rooted in a sense of justice boner that isn’t necessarily conducive to turning a profit.  So what I described as my gut reaction was really my tempered reaction. Unauthorized person (tenant) modified my trash services at apartment building which screwed up my contract and landed a triple bill on my desk."

The duplex is for sale at 750k. The vacant unit was previously rented for $2000 and the other unit is rented for $1800 for a good tenant who always pays rent on time. I believe the rent can be raised to $2000 for this unit. With 20% down payment and the low interest rate, the estimated mortgage including taxes and insurance for us is $3100. The other tenant is currently paying $1800 so we will pay the remaining of $1300 for the mortgage. The duplex is close to my work place (5 mins bike and 20 mins walk) The only problem of the duplex is small back yard and street parking. We are currently in our late 20-30s, we don't have kids, just plan to stay here for 3-4 years, save enough money to buy another house for us to build a family. So my question for smart investments is: what do you think about this property, is it a good investment? Is it a good time to invest in something like this? (With covid now and election is coming) Also, I'm curious why many investors are selling their rental properties? Thank you for any of your inputs. :) Could you please give us some advice?"
132,0,"So I was just perusing through random listings today, and came across this one:

* [House](https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/3845-E-Sourwood-Dr_Gilbert_AZ_85298_M15499-56690)

And there's others like it, I'm not singling out this house for any particular reason.

It looks like a Zillow Owned Home, that they bought 3 weeks ago, cleaned up, and tossed back on the market for 4.9% more.

Doesn't seem like a huge gain at all...and most likely a net loss. So what theory do you think is most likely?

1. They are expecting the property to sell above list price.
2. Their actual purchase cost was somehow lower than the number reported.
3. They are just trying to grow that rapidly side of the business, and are OK with taking a [loss overall](https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/21/business/zillow-rich-barton-risk-takers/index.html), in your typical tech-company-scaling-fast model.
4. Their reselling business is so large that they don't care about making a profit on any individual house, as long as they profit overall across all houses.
5. They rely too much on their own Zestimates. What is Zillow (Owned Homes) Doing?"

135,0,"I am trying to think ahead for the next 2-3 years. I have a condo in a HCOL area which was my primary residence until a couple of months ago. I only put 3.5% down on an FHA loan 3 years ago and i was able to refinance late last year and get rid of PMI as I reached 25% equity and got a conventional loan. Today, I gave the keys to my first tenants and I am really hopeful everything will go well this year.

 I am debating whether I should sell this condo or maintain it as a rental after the 2-3 year mark as any earnings of the sale would be tax free as it was my primary residency the last 3 years. We completely remodeled the condo when we bought it 3 years ago, including updating plumbing, so I hope there wont be large maintenance costs ahead. As of today, I have about ~105k equity but rent cashflow is actually very low, only about $200/ month after PITI, HOA, and expenses. At least for now it's paying for itself and I will continue to get equity for the next couple of years. At least this is what I am telling myself. Does it make more sense to sell and take advantage of the tax free earnings assuming i will maintain or increase equity? Or keep it as a long term investment? My condo is near several biotech companies, a large university, and a great school system so I am hopeful finding good tenants won't be an issue. Also, the rent is below the recommended 1% rule. Its more like 0.70%. 

Is there a way i can make a better assessment of what makes more sense financially? Let me know what you think and thank you for answering my question! Sell condo or maitain as rental"
136,0,"We started looking into a refinance on 23rd July. On the same day we had a loan estimate and signed off on the 500$ charge for getting a fresh appraisal on our condo. We purchased this unit in Jan 2019 at 315K. It is located in a co-op within NJ. 

29th July the appraiser visits our condo and takes a 15-minute look at the unit, takes some measurements and bounces. We receive an apology via text from him on the 9th of August for the delay since he lost power in the storm. 12th August he sends a note to the bank saying he cannot find financial info about he co-op in detail in the original condo-questionnaire and co-op budget documents. Meanwhile the bank keeps repeating to me that they have sent him the condo budgets/questionnaire paperwork thrice already. 

Over a phone call, the bank's employee in charge of this task (Her title: Underwriting analyst) claims she has ""no clue"" what the appraiser is looking for and this conversation is happening on Aug 21. I escalate this out of frustration, the lender calls up the CEO of the AMC and this pushed the appraiser to send out his report on Saturday 22nd Aug. 

Appraiser puts the property valued exactly at what the previous sale was at (315k), leaves red notes saying he did not receive requested info from lender on half the sections of this report and that the report is on an ""as-is"" basis. The bank THEN sends us a NEW condo questionnaire on 23 Aug which needs a bunch of co-op financials filled in. 

Seems like we lost a month of our time and 500$ for a sham appraisal. Ultimately - who was responsible for fishing out this info from our co-op HOA?? Appraiser vs Lender - Who pulls condo financials info?"
137,0,"I've recently started learning more about real estate investing and this is something that's been in the forefront of my mind. I've heard that banks can and will reject you for loans, if you keep getting them to buy more properties, so turning to private equity markets may become a real possibility. Unfortunately those markets tend to have higher interest rates which means worse cash flow. I'm curious if anyone has or knows someone who has experience dealing with bank loan rejections and how they found a workaround? Thank you in advanced. For people who have or know someone who has been rejected by banks for loans, what were next steps?"
138,0,"Longtime lurker... For a variety of reasons, my wife and I are looking into investing in vacation rentals. We have not done any real estate investing before. Our plan is to start close to home (we live near, but not in some high traffic vacation destinations) and see where it leads. We will use a property management service, but my wife is also looking at it as something she can contribute time to do. 

I'm curious what experiences people here have had with investing in vacation properties. How did you approach evaluating properties? What resources did you find helpful? What worked? What didn't work? What should we watch out for? What type of property did you target? What locations? What size property? Did you use a property manager? What listing sites did you use?

139,0,"I'm in my mid-thirties and just got comfortable with regular investing outside of my 401k. I'm really interested in building wealth through rental properties -- I even joined to the Bigger Pockets pro community a year or two ago, but took no action (shame on me) yet.

EDIT: Home state is NJ; cash to buy is about 30K -- 80K if I depleted my savings &amp; brokerage. 

With rates where they are at right now, I'm feeling the pressure to buy a home. I have capital to put currently in a HY personal savings account and brokerage account for a down payment.

My dilemma is that I live in a densely populated, high cost-of living state in the northeast. I live alone, and could continue to rent my current 1 bed unit which is a ""steal"" at 1650 per month, but I understand that could be a monthly payment on a home. I've wondered if I would be better off trying to find a property out of state for under 200K and rent it out -- this would allow me to put down a 20-25% payment -- and as long as it gets rented fairly quickly, I could keep living in my current state (and apartment) while building equity. Not to mention the home prices these days are so inflated to -- I just don't feel like I have the buying power -- and in this market I wouldn't want to dip too much into my savings/investments.

I've also considered buying in my state, but that would require a larger down payment and higher property taxes. I also have reservations about being a landlord in this state, where it may be more cumbersome to evict tenants and everything is just so much more expensive (repairs, renovations, etc) . Also, the desirable areas with good schools are so expensive that the numbers don't really work from a cash-flow perspective. Houses are being snatched up from out-of-state buyers looking to escape cities, and there aren't many foreclosures on the market (yet?). I've grown up here and most of my family is here. I've thought about moving out of State for the right job opportunity, but no solid plans to leave anytime soon in the current job market.

I'm seeking on vice on what would be the better option: investing out of state and saving more capital, or buying a primary residence here, then renting out eventually. I've looked at markets in NC and PA -- areas I've never lived in or visited frequently, but could probably make the numbers work and find units or homes that cash flow. I've even looked at AL, but again don't know much about the state/market. Any advice is greatly appreciated! Best approach to start real estate investing (high COL resident)"
141,0,"A good friend of mine grandfather passed away and left a 3 unit property to his father in Los Angeles. Was excited of the opportunity of having passive income and helping my family as I saw my parents do the same. And also excited that I had at least an in on the property. So I contacted their agent to view the property. Fast forward to a week later and I haven’t got the chance to view the property. Decided to submit an offer anyway with my agent and still try to get a chance to see the place and even he is unable to reach their agent to confirm a time for viewing. My agent thinks their agent is holding back offers to make one offer look more attractive which is ironically the only offer that had been able to view the place. We submit a higher offer and then the seller’s agent says that they have already accepted an offer. Reached out to my friend to confirm with his father. Feeling a little frustrated that I don’t even think I got a fair shot at this and also that their agent would be like this if our suspicions are true. Seems a bit unethical.

Property Type Mobile Home Park

Developed Acreage ±20 Acres 

Use Code 415 - Trailer &amp; MHP 

Parcel Number(s) xx-xxxxx-000 

Flood Zone No 

Opportunity Zone No 

&amp;#x200B;

Offering Memorandums often include this information, and set the tone for the rest of the OM. The things we look for here are the number of sites, and make sure we are aware if the there is Flooding from Fema (Which would make insurance expensive) or if it is an Opportunity Zone (which helps us if we are looking for tax advantages)  We also want to know what kind of park it is and knowing how big of a lot each home sits on helps: 20/132 is .15Ac which is not what we'd consider a ""Park Like Setting"" but it's definitely not a ""Parking Lot Setting"".  There is some yard available for the residents.  


Next we get into some Infrastructure:  


Water Line Material CPVC 

Sewer Line Material PVC 

Road Surface Asphalt 

Driveway Surface Gravel 

Parking Per Site 1-2 Vehicles 

Electrical Amperage 150 Amps   


We've learned here that the utilities have been upgraded, or at least it's not 60+ years old.  Which is great.  It's got real roads, and off street parking which are all good signs of a nicer park.  


  
Utility TIME:  


| UTILITY/SERVICE | TYPE | PAID BY | METERED/ DIRECT BILLED |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| Water | Public | Mixed-Resident/ Community | Sub-Metered |

| Electricity | Public | Resident | Direct-Billed |
| Trash | Contractor | Community ||
| Gas (Propane) | Public | Resident | Direct-Billed |
| Cable/Internet/Phone | Multiple | Resident | Direct-Billed |

Now we are getting some information to make some real analysis  


We've learned that the park in on public utilities.  Which is going to lower our expense ratios, always a good thing.  But when we see that the water/sewer is submetered it tells us that we own the plumbing in the ground, and will have additional cost in maintaining the infrastructure, and will likely have some collection losses.  We also need to research what the rights/responsibilities are for this particular state on whether or not we can shut-off utilities.  


We've also discovered that we have dumpsters, and we will need to factor in that cost and and have a plan to keep the dumpster area from causing problems.   


We see there is propane, so we can assume so additional insurance costs because well, you now have storage of explosive material on site.  Yikes!    


So we've learned some stuff, and can make some assumptions, but I assume you are here for the real good stuff  The Numbers!

Guess where it likely is? - Billed back utilities!  No one is paying their GD water bill!  **This is opportunity for us.**

No listed price!  The seller is disappearing $8000 /mo and then doesn't know how to price their property (or the broker either!)  So now we get to tell them what we think!  


I like to think I'm a generous person, so my initial thought is NOI: (28,363 / 7 months of expenses stated) x 12 (to annualize) = $48,622 at a 10 cap = $486,229  


Do you think they'd go for it?  Probably not because they own 12 POH!  So they are going to want lets say 20k each for another $240k, so we bump up our purchase to $726,229 (lets round for fun sake):   


# CALCULATED OFFER PRICE: $730,000

Then if we figure CapEx:

 40k (price of new homes) x 8 empty pads: $320,000

16 Unsuable pads x 10k to make usable: $160,000

Add another 16 homes @ 40k: $640,000

CAPEX to get to full occupancy:  $1,120,000  


# Total Cash In:  $1,850,000

GSI at full occupancy  126 x $ 250 =  $378,000

225,0,"I first purchased a vacation home in an increasingly popular area for NYC weekenders four years ago. I fixed up the entire house over the course of two years with hybrid DIY and contractor work. 

Realizing the knack my wife and I had for transforming our old home and being design forward, we took the plunge on our first rental property. This is a seasonal vacation area but is popular in both summer and winter (skiing) so shoulder season is fairly short. 

So far it’s done well thankfully. Some quick stats:

Purchase price: $139,000 (25% down)

Renovation: $70,000

Appraised ARV: $310,000

Monthly PITI/maintenance: $1100

Cash flow: $2,800/month

Across both my main home now and my rental property I’m about 30/70 debt to equity. It’s been grueling at times but we’ve built up a sizable amount of equity and put 25% down on both houses. The market has appreciated at a good beat as well. 

So now I’m eyeing my next rental property, but I enjoy buying fixer uppers and renovating to our standards. Of course this has the negative of extended downtime before it’s rental ready. I’m thinking of putting my main house up for rental (it’s definitely not a “forever home” but great for a young couple with a kid) to generate immediate cash and move into the new house to fix up. 

The monthly excess cash generated will certainly cover the new house nut, but it’s $275,000 as the market is a bit hot at the moment. From a cash flow perspective it works but CoC looks a bit weak since it will probably need $50k of work before it starts bringing in $3k+ month after expenses. 

Also I’d only be putting 10% down on this one. The location is absolute prime within the area though and is starting to gentrify so I think outlook is strong. NY annual tourism report shows consistent double digit growth in spend. 

I guess my main concern is I’ll be leveraging up a bit more and I definitely feel like I’m overpaying in the heat of the pandemic. On the flip side it makes sense from a cash perspective as I’ll immediately be using cash flow from my main house to pay for this new property.

I’m considering buying a third house and hoping to run some numbers past some folks to get any additional insights. I’m 34M, I’ve bought and rented two houses over the past 8 years, living in each one while doing some renovations and renting a portion. Moved into my 2nd house about 1.5 years ago and live up and rent 2 basements suites, it’s a triplex. My plan would be to buy a third house and move into it and rent the basement. I live in Canada, bungalows with basement suites are around 350-450K, I would put down 80-100K to get the mortgage payment in the picture. 

Curious to know what people think, is it worth it, should I keep buying and renting like this. The houses I have are in areas where some new builds and infills are being built, on largish lots. I would plan to rent/own any houses for 10+ years.

233,0,"Background: I am a homeowner plus I have a couple of rental properties in my current city.

Due to a family  issue, I need to move to to a fairly popular city on the east coast for a year. 3/2 1500-1700sqft properties rent out for high 2k-4k range, depending on proximity to the beach and whether its furnished. Therefore, it'd realistically cost me $40k to rent for my family for the year.

On the other hand, I can buy a 400-500k property and live it in for a year, then subsequently rent it out. The town recently passed a law that only allows 1% of all homes be allowed a license to operate as a short-term rental (airbnb).  However, STR is defined as anything 30 days or less, so as long as I require at least 1 month, I don't need a STR license.  I'm guessing that I can easily get 3,500/month in rent on a 500k property., and more of I manage to get a STR license for 2021.  

Cons:

* hassle of buying a house, 10-15k in closing costs
* locking up 100k in capital

Pros

* I don't ""lose"" any money to rent
* I usually visit for about a month a  year anyway, so if I keep it as a STR, I have a place to stay
* Property is very likely to appreciate (one of the top cities in the nation for influx of people)

https://www.reddit.com/r/realestateinvesting/comments/i73hpz/sanity_check_this_scenario/


Basic scenario is: I want to cash out refi an investment property in which I have 100% equity (bought for cash). It needs reno and my contractor estimates that it will cost me about $25k to do the reno. The houses in the area are worth at LEAST 2x what I paid (closer to 3x but I like to be conservative).

Here's the Q - 

Let's say after I do the reno the house gets appraised for $250k. I spent about $145k on the purchase + reno. 

How does the appraisal effect how much I can cash out? Can I cash out the whole $145k? Can I cash out more than that (80% LTV) (because the home is worth more)? What happens with home appraisal in cash out refi scenario?"
245,0,"Found a house, initially built in the 1920’s with large additions added in the early 80’s. The back additions sit just a few inches from the back property line, obviously in breach of any current property setback requirements for the local municipality (5ft). 

I plan on flipping the house but was concerned if I would be held responsible for addressing the setback issue (ie. tearing down part (5ft) of the addition to comply with setback requirements) if I started doing major interior renovations. Is this something that is a roll of the dice with the city? And would just be better to pass on? 

I was unable to find any permits for the additions. And the city mentioned that if work was done in the early 80’s and prior, it’s likely they wouldn’t have any paperwork for it. Although I do see the additions referenced on the city appraisal report for the past few years. Old House 6inches from back property line"
246,0,"I've been doing some research on changing demographics. Over the next two decades or so (or specifically 2023 - 2045), the Baby Boomer generation will pass away. This generation currently owns about 40% of real estate. In retirement hubs like Florida and Arizona, where this generation is currently over-represented as a percent of the population, there should be an excess supply of housing. Some of these properties will be inherited by their descendants and immediately put on the market (especially in these retirement hub areas which are far from their relatives), while others will be foreclosed. 

The important thing to remember is that there will be an excess supply of real estate and insufficient demand to maintain current pricing levels. That means it will be a great time to buy in these areas by the end of this decade. Over time, people will eventually notice the fallen costs of real estate in these areas which will attract out-of-state buyers (especially those looking for vacation homes) and movers who wish to become homeowners and are in search of undervalued homes. This should eventually bring the value of real estate back up.

352,0,"I got a message back about an off market duplex. It's a vacant overgrown poorly maintained home but in a really great neighborhood. This would be a buy and hold property that my wife and I would house hack/occupy 1 unit while renting out the other. From the looks of it, there will be quite a bit of rehab needed but I think it can be a good opportunity — as a 1st time buyer/investor, I want to make sure I'm following the right steps moving forward.

1. I'm hoping to jump on a call soon to hear more about the property. Below is what I'll ask:

\-What kind of condition is it in?   
\-How long since someone has lived there?   
\-Whats the status of the HVAC/Roof/Sewer/Appliances?  
\-Any repairs recently done or needed that you’re aware of?  
\-Do you have a price in mind?

Is there anything else I should being asking them at this point? Next step would be to schedule a time to walkthrough the property to document and take pictures. After that I'll figure out comps and repair estimates.

2. Any tips for estimating repair? Do we just use a generic (ex: $40 sq ft) number or have a contractor do a walkthrough? How/when would we have a contractor walkthrough? Is there a fee for that?

After comps and accurate estimates I'll be putting in an offer. Is that usually a verbal offer or something more formal?

3. Since its a buy and hold rental, do you still use 75% of ARV minus repairs as an offer amount? I'm more interested in Cash on Cash and cashflow. The 25% spread/profit would only be beneficial if I sell or refinance, correct?

4. Should I use a realtor? A realtor told me it would be 3-4% for them to handle paperwork for both buyer/seller. They wouldn't really be in my corner but mostly just handling the transaction. Is that typical? I would want the realtor to help with comps/negotiations etc but doesn't sound like they would be doing that in these situation.

5. The final curve ball is the property has two owners...siblings that are both in care homes. I've been in touch with their family. Family has power of attorney for one sibling but not the other.

About my situation
---
I work fully remote for a tech company, so it was very easy for me to consider self managing a property while still working full time because of the flexibility with my schedule. I chose to move out of state to Wyoming, since changing my residency from Colorado to Wyoming netted me an instant 4.63% raise due to Wyo not having state income tax. I chose Wyoming because it has all the same stuff I love about Colorado (great outdoors, lower cost of living, friendly people), but without the droves of people that have descended upon the front range. I also think Wyoming is poised to grow in the coming years (especially so now with COVID). For those of you that don't know, Wyoming is in a bit of a pickle with oil and gas on their way out; it's left the state with a large budget deficit meaning our government needs to explore other options for revenue.

One of those options has been cryptocurrency, and in fact Wyoming legislators have been incredibly open to brining in cryptocurrency businesses - leading to us having some of the most  forward-thinking cryptocurrency regulations in the country. I think in general tech will surge in this market due to the extremely low cost of living, with great quality of life activities available to employees (tax rates don't hurt either).

The Deal
---
So anyways, we're here for the real estate, not my life story. I knew early on that I wanted to buy in Laramie; it's close to home, has the only university in Wyoming, and has great small town vibes paired with lots of stuff going on thanks to a sizable college student population. My requirements were fairly basic:
 
1. Close to campus 
2. In the ""historic"" district
3. At least 2 units (for house hacking purposes)
4. High potential for equity gain
5. If possible, cashflow positive within a year

Laramie has stayed fairly price stable over the years, seeing a modest bump in prices thanks to spillover from the explosion in the front range. Rent here is affordable, but so are the houses so it's pretty easy to buy something that cash flows. I started my search by seeing a few duplexes or houses with ""mother-in-law"" suites, but none of these were quite in the area that I wanted, and lacked the ""charm"" that I was looking for. What's more, I quickly found that houses were getting bought faster than I had anticipated. 

There was a listing that I kept going back to, aptly titled ""diamond in the rough"". It was an old house from 1890 that had been split up into 4 units at some point, but it still needed a lot of work. The 9000+sqft lot was completely overgrown, and you could barely see the house from the street https://imgur.com/a/U0P1i4v. Inside some units had been renovated, but the main floor units were both in need of some serious renovation (toilets weren't installed, carpet in one of the kitchens that needed to be torn up, etc). There was also a huge addition built on to the back of one apartment which just added to the overall funkiness of the place.

The more I looked at it though, the more I was starting to see the diamond. Locationwise it was exactly where I wanted to be, and at just 1 block from campus I would always have students to rent to. Pricewise it was well under the average cost in the area at $303k, and once all four units were up and running it would be cashflow positive, and likely generate $80k+ of equity. To make a long story short, I put in an offer, and after 30 days of inspections and questioning my sanity the house was mine!

Where are we now?
---
It's been just about a year, and so far I've met all of my targets. I'm living in one of the main floor units (the one with carpet in the kitchen... it's still there for now haha), and did a full remodel on the other main floor unit into an Airbnb that is simply killing it. As an apartment it would maybe rent for $500/month, and so far it's averaged nearly $900/month (the best month in July was over $1400 though). The two upstairs apartments are rented out to long term, young professionals that take great care of the place, and in total bring in another $1270/month. We're well on pace to net over $25,000 this year, with the Airbnb only operating for 3/4 quarters.

In the immediate future I'll be turning the front two rooms of my apartment into an additional Airbnb, and I'll be commandeering the funky addition. Based on experience, I know that economies of scale will mean the cost of running the Airbnb will decrease as more units are added, and my goal is to eventually hire someone to take care of the management. There's still loads of yard work to be done, but I'm already eyeing up other properties and hope to add at least 2 more over the next year, and refi this property to access some of the newly built equity!

505,0,"Hi everyone. This is my first post in this sub and I’m still in the learning phase of real estate investing and I am trying to find my market. Next year my husband and I are moving to a major state university town in the Midwest for our jobs. We are looking to invest in a town right outside of it (10-15min drive to the college town) and it has a population of only less than 10k. People live in this area for the excellent school system because the system in the college town is not desirable. It looks like there are plans for development in the area over the next at least 10 years and the population has been growing fairly consistently over the last few years as well. When I look at SFH rentals on Zillow there are not very many... which could mean that there is a significant demand or no demand at all ... I’m not sure how to tell except to look at Zillow daily and see how long a listing stays up... so if you have tips on how I might be able to understand this better I would be so grateful! 

We are hoping to buy a duplex (brand new) with an FHA loan and rent the other side. I need to go through the numbers in detail to understand if we will cash flow but my main question is would you invest in this area knowing the details above ? Would you invest in a small town of less than 10k?"
507,0,"I currently rent a 1900sqft loft downtown, but am needing to get out so I have room for my boat and other things. I'm looking into purchasing a property as my primary residence in a very desirable and up and coming neighborhood in my city. The property has a main house with detached double garage with carriage house, which has been converted into a full 1br apartment, and is currently renting for $800 a month by the current owner. As far as I can tell (house is not on market yet), that includes  water/electric/internet. I'm trying to understand about how much of this rental income is actually going to be profit, and if renting this apartment is worth hassle and loss of privacy.  

I'm pre-approved through a local credit union, and qualify as a first time home buyer. The house will be $400k, and i'll be purchasing with only 5% down @ 3.7% interest with no PMI, and a monthly payment of $1750.

This investment seems like a great deal. I just don't know how all the numbers shake out with the rental, and am hoping you guys can help shine some light on what I should expect in terms of actual cash flow. Buying house and renting carriage house over garage."

My question is for people who had primarily traded stocks for years before buying real estate investments.  Was it to diversity?, Get away from market volatility? or something else?  

I currently own no major assets aside from an 8 year old pickup truck.  I was wanting to buy property for myself, but I hate the idea of giving up capital right now with no return.  I have been looking into some multi-families to buy to at least have cash-flow, but even then giving up capital significantly hurts my buying power in the market.  I'm just wondering how others came to their decision to move most of their money from market to real estate.

PS. I understand stock Market is risky and majority people don't recommend ""day trading.""

edit: People seem to be confused about my wording.  Yes I am talking about investment property. I brought up personal property because I had originally decided against buying something strictly for myself because I didn't want to give up majority of my capital at this moment.

521,0,"Hey all, been lurking on this sub for a while and I’d like your advice on what to do with a piece of property I have. 

A little backstory: I’m 22. Purchased my first home (1980 doublewide) from my grandfather 2 years ago. I joined an apprenticeship program straight out of high school, and between my typically frugal self and living with my parents, I was able to save up the 40k my grandfather wanted for his doublewide, and write him a check for it. Before you say that I took advantage of him/elder abuse, everyone involved knew it was a good deal, including my mom and aunt (gramps’ only kids) who turned down the offer when it was offered to them. The house did come with the caveat of 30 years worth of deferred maintenance and they only took half an apartments worth of stuff out of the house when they moved to their retirement home, and I was left to deal with all their stuff they left behind. 

Anywho, I’m looking to figure out what I would like to do long term worth the place, and the best way to use it as a rental. It sits on 3/4 of an acre, just outside city limits (my property line is the boundary), on a septic. I see a couple of options, from least to most favorable in my view, and would like y’alls input. 

1. Keep the double wide, fix her up and rent her out. This option I like the least. As I said, 30 years of deferred maintenance. I live in it and rent out two rooms to friends now, but I wouldn’t feel comfortable renting it to the general public without gutting the place. Floors, roof, walls, siding would all need replaced

2. Tear it down and put up a single family home. Saves me an effort of gutting the mobile, and gives me a new rental property, with minimal hassle. 

3. Tear it down and put up a duplex/triplex/etc. This one appeals to me because of the multiple possible income streams, so if one unit is vacant I’m not totally in the whole. There is the added complication that the home is on a septic. Can you have a septic for a 4 plex? There’s sewer at the end public road, probably 100’ away. I imagine it would be expensive to get that ran to my house, but I don’t really know. I would also have to have the city annex the property if I wanted anything bigger than a duplex, because of zoning laws in the county. 

I appreciate the input! Unique situation with mobile home"
522,0,"Hello All,

Excuse the expression, but I have grown hungrier recently. I have found myself  1) aggressively trying to create more passive income streams 2) digesting more investing/finance resources  3) throwing a lot of money at the market and 4) trying to get into real estate investing.

I come from a blue-collar background and my parents were extremely frugal, affording them the ability to have little debt, decent net worth and real estate portfolio. They really are not investors though.

Due to my interests in real estate investing and experiencing some difficulties through the real estate process (especially mortgage financing)  myself, I decided to go for my real estate agent salesperson license to expand my knowledge base and opportunities.

I know, I know. I read your most recent opinions on the sub. But that's why I am here. I didn't go for my license for any particular reason. I just love to learn, create things and have a business mindset. I'm finishing my teaching cert this year. I could hold a RE license by this October, and I'll probably go for a PMP cert after that. I also have a SMLLC  (for various income streams through etsy, TpT, fiverr,  niche blogs, etc) and  I have a 50% interest in an MMLLC landscaping company I operate.

I don't know what path I want to go down, want to learn more and am interested in a variety of things like wholesaling, rentals, crowdsourced REIT securities, how to properly leverage my credit, thought about developing private equity fund that invests in wholesale contracts, etc.

The realtor working on my parents' open listing wants me to help her handle her properties while she is away and she works for a  broker that takes nothing because they provide no resources essentially, so she buys her leads from  Zillow.

So much opportunity, I feel like I'm chasing my tail.

678,0,"I live in British Columbia near Vancouver. Obviously property is very expensive here and finding property that would break even is pretty difficult but I've found some condos that I think I'll be able to make a decent profit off of. 

I currently have $88 000 saved and make enough to afford $480 000.

My plan is to purchase an older condo near a city center. The asking price is 230k for a 1 bedroom 700 sq ft built in 1982 about 30 minutes outside of Vancouver that is near transit. The strata fee is $286/month and property tax is $1000. After including income taxes/write offs and all fees I'll need to rent out the property for about $1200/month to break even this includes the mortgage, strata and property tax.

I'm confident that the unit could easily rent out for $1100-1200 as it currently is. The unit is very dated doesn't have washer/dryer or a dishwasher but is top floor corner unit and the building has an elevator. My dad has a construction company and can help me renovate the unit for a lower cost, I also have experience in renovating my last property. I believe if I invest $15 000 into renos I'll be able to significantly improve the unit add washer/dryer and a dishwasher. A brand new unit in the area of similar size rents for around 1700-1800 so based on that k believe I could get around 1500-1600 which would leave me with around 3-4000 in profit annually (including the extra $15000 for renos).

My plan would be to move into the unit as it is renovate it while living in it then save to purchase my next property (would take about a year to get enough for the next downpayment @ 20%) at which point I would begin to rent this unit out. Then repeat this process. 

My questions are

Is this the correct order to do things in? Should I just renovate it not live in it and rent it out and continue to rent where I currently am ($800 a month).

If this unit was to only break even Id be paying off around $5000 principal each year and this would be about a $52 000 investment. Meaning I should get anywhere between 10-18% ROI %10 would be in equity

How much of a benefit is it to add a washer/dryer and dishwasher?

Is a top corner unit seen as the most desirable for a renter? Is maybe a ground floor unit seen as more desirable?

Are my margins too tight? It's very hard to find potential profit in rentals in this market

The second issue is management. It seems almost impossible to find a decent property management company in these locations. Compared to HCOL cities, tons of management options and professionalism. 

I don’t see any reason to invest in properties over a REIT if I’m getting the same income for virtually no work. 

In HCOL cities, they get higher rents, higher appreciation, better quality tenants, easier management, less risks.

I'm analyzing a beautiful 3 unit property, it looks like its fully occupied with long term tenants(3)  
Although it still cash flows, all 3 units are under rented.  


The stats below:  
(2) 3 bed room units are rented for 900 - market rate is 1200-1400  
(1) 2 bed room unit is rented for 700 - market rate is 900-1100  


I don't know the condition of the units yet, since the pics do not show them but I can speculate that low rents are due to long term tenants.  


When analyzing this property, should I analyze it with current rent roll? or closer to marker rents?

My plan is to purchase one property for 300k-400k with a 200k loan and use the remaining cash to purchase a few C class properties. 

One of issues I'm trying to work through is how to purchase the 300-400k property. Initially qualifying for a conventional loan may be difficult due to a high DTI even though I will have plenty of equity and more than enough reserves. A few of the properties I've been considering are bank owned and require a cash buyer. So, one option I've considered is buying the larger property with cash (lets say 300k), then refi that property and use the cash from the refi (200k) to purchase the other properties.

889,0,"Ok, I watched a video from Stephan about how he purchased a property for $0. When he said that he borrowed a $600k loan to pay for $500k mortgage and pocket the rest as profit, I was dumb folded. How can taking out a bigger loan to pay a smaller loan be considered ""profit""? 

I do understand the basic of his strategy, like buying cheap property, make some improvement to get higher value. Get back to the bank to take out a bigger loan for it.

Sure, I got it, he pulled the money to invest in some other properties which will increase his portfolio. But....won't it make the mortgage more expensive? 

Also, let's say he has 10 houses in his portfolio, each cost $500k, but the moment he has any equity in the house, he immediately withdraw it to invest in other house. From the outside, it looks like he ""own"" 10 properties, but in fact he has zero equity in all of them, and if the economy take a hit and people lose jobs and can't pay back rent, he can't pay the bank.

Won't this backfire and blow up in people's face? 

When I say I have 5 million invested in stock, I literally has 5 millions worth of equity sitting in my account. But 5 million in property is just 5 million borrowed from the bank. Does it feel like playing with fire? Because when there is an economic downturn, at least I can liquidate some of my stocks for quick cash. But housing, on the other hand, is much harder to sell, and I still don't own the house until I pay back all the mortgage....which get much more expensive because I keep refinancing and taking out bigger loans for the loans for them.

That's why I don't understand why people use this strategy. Of course Stephan is rich and more successful than me so obviously he is doing something right. I just don't get how it can sustain in long term. I'm confused about taking loans from existing property"

I lived there for a few years and have rented it to a family friend for the past 8 years for the friendly rate of $500 a month. The small amount of rent has paid the house off and I have probably profited a nominal amount already.

Prices in that area are still low but have stabilized around $60k. I was recently approached by an investor who made an offer of $20k. It seems a little low for the current market value but the house needs new windows, roof repair, siding and maybe a furnace in the near future. 

I have one other investment property that is better condition with stable renters in the same area. I have a full time job so little time, energy and money to put into this house. 

I am seriously considering the offer. I don't depend on the income and fear an expensive repair or two is looming.

1100,0,"Hello everyone,

My mother (70) will be giving me her home as she is moving back to her home land to “finish the rest of her life” where she grew up and to be with her sisters and last brother.

Essentially, she’s giving me the home.

Here are some details

- The deed is on her name, so is the mortgage.
- The monthly mortgage payment is about $1200 at 3%
- The remaining balance is 125k on mortgage 
- The property taxes are 12k a year
- Home insurance is $1500

The upstairs rents for $2500

Home value: 390k +

I feel like $1500 is still quite a lot. Would it be possible to refinance both in her name and my name although I have a chapter 7 bk that’s a year old? My income is about 70k  with a 700 credit score 

Her income is about 90k but a score of 600

I am a newbie RE investor and haven't purchased my first home yet. I spent the last couple of months educating myself and building proper deal analysis tools. I will need another couple of months to save up some money and improve my credit before making my first purchase but I am already starting to reach out to Realtors in the area to send me deals.

The very first deal I was sent was this:

Price: $360,000

BR: 7 Beds, 4 Baths  
Year Built: 1925  
County: Davidson County

Monthly Rents: $4,200  
CoC Return: 15.53%  
Caprate: 7.80%  
1% rule: 1.17%  


I am quoting the listing on the rent price right now:

"" The triplex is currently a group home generating $4200/mo and tenants are on a month-to-month lease. Property has a 14% cap rate. If converted back to a functional triplex, rents can be held for $1,200-$1,400 per unit without any add'l improvements. Current format has 7 bedrooms and 4 bathrooms. ""

1105,0,"After an exhausting amount of research and a couple flights, we just got an offer accepted on our first multifamily. Slated to close 9/30. 

**Overview**

""3 family"" house with off-street parking in a mid-sized midwest city. Fantastic walkable urban area that's been steadily on the rise for the last \~15 years. I actually lived 2 blocks away in a renovated loft building 10 years ago when the neighborhood was really getting started but now reside/rent in Brooklyn. House is walking distance to the riverfront, restaurants, coffee shops, shopping, movie theater, and an aquarium. About 1 mile from downtown and all that entails, including two major league sports stadiums, museums, and tons of development. Also on our side of the river a few blocks away is a $40 million mixed-use development including retail, office, hotel, housing, and an indoor/outdoor concert venue. Phase 1 is slated to open later this year.

Our offer was for listing $159,900, with the seller paying closing costs (\~$4k) contingent on the inspection. House was up for 3 days, had an offer on the second day. Our agent reached out while they were in negotiations. We got in yesterday and made an offer on the spot. We have a 14 day inspection period and are flying back in to handle the inspection and will probably stay through closing.

We got a 3.375% rate with 25% down on a fixed 30 conventional, looking like the payments are going to be $880/mo all-in. Utilities average out to \~$150/mo for the building as-is. Currently the only revenue from the building is $800/mo leaving basically a $230 deficit we're looking to make up ASAP. While we'd love to house hack, our jobs currently have us in NY and we don't imagine living in this property maybe ever, but at least not for the next 3-5 years.

From our research, and discussions with our agent, we estimate we can get $2300-$2500/mo for all 3 units after making 5-9k in updates.

**Property Details**

2,005 sq. ft. brick three story built in 1883. Furnace is less than a year old, roof looks like it's maybe 2-3 years old max. Bottom floor has central air (unit is a bit older, maybe 5-7 years) as well as exclusive access to the full unfinished basement with W/D. Utilities are not currently separated and we're responsible for handling all utilities (yikes). Whole house exterior was painted less than a year ago. Has a newer driveway that ends in a carport and 1 car garage. No yard, which is actually a huge plus for us since we don't live there and don't want the additional cost of maintaining it.

**Current Tenant Situation**

It's currently setup as an \*almost\* 3 family with one of the units occupied: 

Bottom floor is a 2br/1ba. Tenant has access to the front porch and entire driveway. Is currently month-to-month but has lived there for 10 years.

  
Current rent is $800. Comp rents in the area are $1050-1300. Thinking of maybe bumping them up \~$100 or charging them a flat-rate for utilities or driveway access just to make the house self sufficient while we sort out the other two floors.

Second floor is setup as a 1br/1ba and has been vacant for a year. My guess is the owner was interested in selling the house and put their effort into getting it more presentable to a buyer vs worrying about turning over the unit. Probably needs 3-5k to get it where we want it. Could probably get it rentable for \~$2k but feel like we could fetch more desirable tenants and slightly higher rents if we put the extra cash in now.

Third floor is an efficiency (we call it a spacious studio in NYC...) and needs another 2-4k to get it rentable. Have no idea when it was lived in last, no kitchen appliances and currently...no toilet. None of which is really a big deal, my father is big into storage room auctions and has a garage full of appliances and my sister married into a family that runs an HVAC and plumbing company.

The issue is it's a third floor walkup, which is apparently a large deal in the midwest, and the space is quite small. Our thoughts are to turn it into an AirBnb as we fear it may be hard to find a tenant. As mentioned above, the area is very walkable and is probably one of only a handful of neighborhoods in the city that Airbnb is viable in. Plus we love the idea of having a place to stay when we're in town as we visit a handful of times a year already which is likely to increase now that we own the property. All that said, it seems like some dice that we're willing to roll. Especially if we get the second floor occupied. 

There is also a large 1 car garage that the previous owner used for storage that I plan to offer to the current downstairs tenant for $100-150 a month or rent to someone else. Off-street parking is rare in the neighborhood, garages are even more rare. Lots of folks in the area may be interested in renting the garage either to store a nicer vehicle or motorcycle, or just as a very central storage location.

**Questions**

1. How to handle the downstairs tenants?

They're very reliable and the consistency is nice. However, they're grossly underpaying for what they have. Our immediate plan is to not rock the boat too much in the short term until we get at least the second floor unit operational. Raise their rent? Put them on a lease? Charge for utilities or driveway access? Segue:

2. How to make up the deficit?

As mentioned, the house operates at a \~$230 loss monthly as-is. Not a huge deal for us as we budgeted for a totally vacant property and anticipated covering a (higher) mortgage for 6-9 months. However, we'd love to get the house to be self-sufficient. I suppose we have a few options: raising the downstairs tenants rent, charging them a flat-fee for utilities, renting the garage out, charging for driveway access. 

3. How to handle utilities?

From our initial research, it looks like separating utilities is kind of a nightmare. Is it worth the hassle? Is it out of line to ask tenants to pay a flat-fee for utilities?

4. What to do with the second and third floors?

We have a few options here. The first is to take whats already there and run with it: turning both floors around and operating the second as a 1br/1ba and the third as a studio or airbnb. The wildcard is turning these floors into a 2br duplex. It would probably net out the same from a revenue standpoint as we imagine we could get $1200-$1300/mo for it. The issue is it'll take a very particular tenant. Someone that has enough income to purchase their own property, but chooses not to for whatever reasons. The rehab costs involved is probably comparable or $1-2k more. 

Any advice or opinions are welcome! We're tying not to get too excited until the inspection clears, but want to plan ahead as much as we can. Offer accepted on first multifamily!"

1107,0," I popped by the property because I wanted to see how things were going inside, and found some guys doing work on the roof. I had no idea they were going to be there. The owner of the company, said they talked to my GC and had sent a contract over and the GC said the property was good to go. After I called my partner, he said that he was still comparing two companies. And that they weren’t supposed to have started. We hadn’t even signed a contract for who was working for us.. The GC just said that “the property is ready to go”, not to start work on it..

Now the roofer is saying how he needs the money for supplies (down payment in the contract). And that he’s ready to just walk because my GC hasn’t been replying to him, or sending the money. Which i know my partner has been talking with him. Honestly, I don’t care if he walks, he’s been a pain in my ass. The only things I’d worry about is that his workers basically demo’ed the roof, and would walk away with nothing. And the fact that if he walked he’d leave big ass holes in the roof where they removed the skylights. 

What are your thoughts on this?

Note: I’m not the one that deals with the contractors, we got a GC specifically because I’d rather not deal with all this BS.

Update: Sort of got it sorted. Turns out the roofer occasionally works for the other roofer we were looking into. The first roofer is going to be working under the second for this job. I’m really not sure what it’s going to fix, but everyone seems happy and we’re on our way. So I couldn’t ask for a better outcome.

1116,0,"Hey everyone - I've been wanting to get into land investing, essentially buying and selling land (in my case just looking at recreational land to not deal with any sort of utilities or issues like that) and sell the land via owner financing. The reason I'm heading in this direction has to do with capital I have for investment. I don't have enough to get into the rental business at the moment, and it seems like the barrier to entry for land is lower, albeit the sale may not be as guaranteed, but I can worry about that later.

That being said, some things I've heard is that the easiest way to find potential buyers is to get the delinquent property tax lists for a given county, then sending out cold emails with offers or contact info. My main questions:  


1. What is the best way to get ahold of these tax lists? REtipster mentions DataTree as a way of getting the info in an easy to read form. I also know you can directly reach out to the tax assessor to get a prepared list. Is there a better tool or is reaching out directly the best way?
2. What is a good way to find areas in the country to focus on? It would be good to see where people are buying and use that to get an idea, but at the same time I realize that's not always possible. I'm fine reaching out individually, but I also want to make sure I'm being smart on where I focus on. Does it come down to just ""pick an area I think is good and hone in on that?""

1121,0,"Thank you all for your time. I currently have a rental property in a small rural town that I’m having issues with. Got a call recently from a friend of Tenant 1. The friend said Tenant 2 came home that morning and flipped out that Tenant 1 had said friend over. The story goes Tenant 2 punched holes in the wall (I have yet to see the damages) and “threatened” Tenant 1. I immediately told the friend to call 911 and have help come mediate the situation and if they really felt threatened to leave until officers arrived. An update later from the friend was very not very informative but they did say an officer came and told them there really wasn’t much to be done. I again told them if another threat was made call the authorities and leave. Today I tried to contact Tenant 1 to get their end of the story with no response. Tenant 2 did contact me back but was not available today to really give a call and explain. 

Both tenants names are on the lease so neither can kick each other out and neither want to give up their right to rent the property. This is a month to month lease, should I just send out notification that I’m terminating the lease all together or should I try to just evict Tenant 2? Neither have ever given me trouble till now. They pay right on time every time. 

I apologize in advance if this is a terrible question. I’m just trying to weigh my options. Tenant threatening another tenant"

I am in Las Vegas and looking to purchase my first property. I wanted either a fourplex or a duplex that I would live in as well as rent out. I've decided on just going for a duplex because all the fourplexes are in too bad of areas. Though maybe for my next property!

There is a duplex for sale, $315,000 (price dropped $10k recently). It's been on the market for 140 days, two other buys fell out for various reasons. One unit is 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom and the other is a 2 Bed + Den/1 Bath. 

It's in a not great part of Henderson, which is a generally better subsection of Vegas. It's super close to an up and coming downtown area of Henderson, with new construction going on in the area.

1363,0,"Hey y’all. I’m new to this sub so I apologize if this has been brought up already. I’ve been following the REI scene for awhile now and came across a guy named Doug Depte on Instagram. He’s from the Philadelphia area (right in my backyard) and posts often about building wealth through real estate in the hood. What I feel sets him apart from other gurus is his highly informative videos about property financing and construction. He speaks a lot about using business credit but I don’t quite understand how it works, because he speaks sort of vaguely on it. I’ve seriously considered buying some books to read up on it, though

Doug’s content led me down the rabbit hole and I discovered some other people like him. They mostly follow the same theme: buy completely trashed property in the hood, do extensive rehab or even new construction, and finance with hard money and business credit. 

Has anyone in this sub heard of him or any of these people? I’m a fan of Doug and considered buying his course, but it’s $7500 and that’s a steep price tag, despite being very interested in what he does.

EDIT: I apologize if this is a jumbled mess with no point, I just needed to get all of this written down

We asked how they got his cell phone number, and we didn't get any response. 

Now just last week, we got a phone call from some random area code (sounded like it might've been a call center), asking if we were interested in selling this same property.

1373,0,"Hi all,

I'm new to the REI world and want to start off by showing appreciation for this community. I've learned a lot in a short amount of time, and the dialogue here is refreshingly productive. 

Here's a little background: I currently live in a highly competitive market but likely won't relocate, which leaves me with the option of investing remotely. After searching around, it seems like there are numerous pitfalls and horror stories with this approach (especially as a first time investor), but I'm willing to stomach the risk and give it a shot. My current liquidity is \~100k, and my goal is to maximize cash flow while also keeping an eye on appreciation (i.e. ideally cash flow + appreciation, but just cash flow is fine).   


Keeping this in mind, Savannah, GA has caught my attention based on a few details: 

* Mostly warm weather
* Tourism trending up
* Near Charleston
* Reliable jobs (military, construction equipment producers, etc)
* Affordable prices

I'm slightly concerned about the crime rates, but I think that issue can be navigated based on carefully assessing the neighborhoods to purchase in. 

Here are my questions:

* Does anyone have experience investing in this area? If so, what are you stories?
* If not here, do you have any other areas you might suggest given my background? First property — maximizing cash flow"

1627,0,"For many years I've been buying multifamily properties in popular urban areas, fixing them up, and then renting them out to college students or Millennials.  However, everybody and their brother has been doing the same thing and the yields are so low that I don't think it makes sense to get another one.  

Sniffing around for other opportunities there appears to be more money in single-family homes in a rural area near me.  However, the price for something new is quite expensive.  And I don't really like what I see for sale.  But lots are cheap, a 2-acre lot goes for about $100K.

1632,0,"Hi all, I am graduating with my Master's degree in engineering from Columbia next year and am starting to think about pulling the trigger on a home. I am originally from San Francisco, where my parents own multiple rental properties, so I am pretty familiar with the basic ins and outs of property ownership. Once I graduate, my wife will be applying to a PhD program (she already has an MS in economics) and we are not sure where that will take us. However, we do not want to be spending money on rent for the next year or year and a half. With the pandemic going on, we figured that it might be a good time to buy a place to live in for the mean time, and potentially rent out afterwards.

We know that co-ops are very restrictive on renting, so that is out. Our budget is probably between 400-700k. We have the down payment ready, it's just a question of what we like what is a good investment now.

Since co-ops are out, that only leaves studios and 1 bdrms in NYC for us in our price range. Plus, we own a car and cannot imagine letting it go, so we also want 1 parking spot. So even less options in the city. However, I am still drawn to the city because I think due to the flight to suburbia, it could present very good investment opportunities. On the other hand, the supply of housing for sale has only increased less than 10% year over year, and a broker friend of ours tells us that sales over asking are common, so is there really an opportunity?

Cue to suburbs. We want to have children in the next year, so we want a larger home. We want space, we want parking spots, a garden for our dog, and we are vintage furniture junkies, so we would love to fill up the home with cool objects. But is it a good investment? We are looking mostly at north NYC, like New Rochelle, Armonk, Briarcliff Manor, Ossining, Chappaqua, White Plains, etc. Towns that are less than an hour drive from the city. We love urban life and are foodies, and we find that most of the eclectic groceries we want are in the city. So for that, we want to stay close. And of course, for jobs, etc.

The curve ball here is, like I said, my wife will be applying to PhD programs and we don't know where that will take us. We want to invest as we really don't want to keep paying rent here (currently in Edgewater, NJ). I think we want to strike a balance between suburban living close to the city, and a good investment. Is this the classic real estate investing dilemma? Any thoughts on how the market will move with the pandemic? I personally don't think the flight to the burbs will be permanent, and I strongly feel, as someone who has studied investing extensively and holds a CFA Charter, that people will flock back to the city in the next few years. We do want something that will be easily rentable if we have to move, so that puts us off the suburbs a bit. However, we love nature, we want greenery, and a backyard and garage. Is the rental market is strong in north of NYC? 

Lotta questions here, but any broad input would be greatly appreciated as my wife and I have been arguing and fighting a lot about what's a good plan for us. Thanks everyone. Are NYC suburbs a good investment prospect?"

They gave us 3.65% first. I balked and requested an explanation. They came back and said the interest rate was high because of something new with Fannie and Freddie Mac, and after review the credit union has decided to absorb the additional costs. The new offer is 3.125%.

1927,0,"Looking at a property here in the Southeast. Home was built in 80s on a slab. Uncommon, as most rental construction around here is older, and on a crawlspace. It was likely about 950ft originally, and had a large addition put on at some point in the 90s. Originally a 3/1, when the addition went on, it was converted to a 2/2, with a VERY large master suite, with a wheelchair-accessible bathroom. Has a fully tiled floor, with wide roll-in shower, and handrails everywhere. Most doors in the home are wide enough for a large chair. There is a large 2-car garage, and there's only a 3"" lip from the garage to the rest of the house, with a nice aluminium ramp going up. Now it's over 1400ft.

It's a very desirable part of town from a rental standpoint, but a 3br would typically beat a 2br by a wide margin. 2br top of market is typically about 1200/mo. A 3br on the same lot would bring over 1600/mo. 

Anyone have experience with that type of home, and what it means for rental rates? What does wheelchair accessibility add to rental value?"

1930,0,"Hi all, first time posting here.

I purchased a house last April, in which I live, that is attached to a vacant property we'll call 3314. They're twin townhouses in a decent area outside of a major city in my state.

3314 is a complete 1500sqft shitshow. It's been on the market for at least 3 years. The previous owners (an old couple) had turned the single-family home into a 2-unit apartment (illegally), and the husband died. The wife now owns it and is still making payments on the mortgage (she owes $70,000), but the house is in such bad shape that it isn't even worth $30,000 realistically. Her real estate agent has even told her to just stop making payments on the damn thing and let it go to foreclosure but apparently she's too proud.

The house is just simply bad. According to city rules, it must be returned back to single-family. I don't know about the foundation, but I know it's going to need a brand new roof, and the rest of the house will need complete rehab. Holes in the first floor ceiling that go clear through to the second story. Gaping hole in the basement exterior wall. I'm talking a strip-it-down-to-its-bare-bones-and-start-over type of flip. My house was done just like this before I bought it - I didn't do the work, but it seems like it's happening more and more in my neighborhood.

I'm curious if anybody has any legal or experienced advice for me, a young guy who is toying with the idea of flipping and selling the house over the next couple years. I've been contemplating these couple of options:

1. Waiting the owner out until she dies too, and when the house goes up for auction by the bank, getting it that way.
2. Calling the bank and telling them the property is a liability for them (and a potential hazard for me), and that they should send an inspector out to see if it's condemnable. I don't know about this one, just an idea someone gave me.
3. Offering the owner like $15,000 just to take it and have it and then doing whatever I want with it.
4. Option I haven't considered and you'll suggest
5. Another option I haven't considered and you'll suggest
6. Forgetting the whole thing and just watching it rot.

Again I clearly don't have a lot of experience in buying abandoned/vacant properties with a ton of work that needs to be done. I do, however, have a vested interest in the property as it's directly connected to my own, which I want to sell someday, and the capital to invest.

Please share some thoughts and advice? Thank you. House next-door is in total disrepair and I might be stupid enough to buy it. [USA]"
1932,0,"Hey, everybody. My first post in here.

I Want to ask for some advice about my first steps on Real State investment. A little background: I work on a good real estate development company in Latin America. I have a good job. I´m one of the managers and earn a fair amount of money (considering earnings on Latin America) (not crazy-I´m starting my job as a manager) I end every month with around 30% of my income for savings. (No emergency found - No car debt - One good apartment on a good place: (Paying around 33% of my income for that apartment)

**The apartment:** This is my first apartment. I just leave my parent's house and this was my way out to move with my girlfriend. I pay around $160.000 for my apartment ($120.000 on debt and I pay $40.000 on DP) but the real price for the apartment is around $210.000,00 this was kind of a gift/bonus to me from my boss and he gave me that good price as a gift. I have a good relationship with my boss (who is a great guy with a great family company) I Love my job and I have a great projection to even do better on a couple of years. I made a lot of connections with a lot of people from all kinds of industries, etc. – If I want to sell this apartment I can get $210.000,00 easy, or if I want to rent it I can rent it on $1500 per month easy. This apartment it's on a semi-luxury building (on Latin America basis), spa, Gym, good pool, etc. If I change to a regular neighborhood (like where I used to live with my parents I can just pay around $600 - $700 per month

**Opportunities with my job on a Development Company:**   As you may know, it's not a good time for the development of new apartment buildings because of COVID 19. Maybe on another, 2-3 years will be a good time and we can start developing another Building and I can get a great price on the new apartments from my boss and do that again (buy low-sell high. That’s also important to mention, I can get a great price on every building we make.

**About my income:** I make around $3000 a month after taxes/social security, etc. That, in Latin America, is over 80% of the average income. I do well. I know it's not a lot to start making a crazy investment but in my country is a good income. I live well on a regular basis.  We spend around $1000 on food, utilities, etc per month. and I have to pay around $1000 for my apartment mortgage.

**The potential first investment:** I have this opportunity to buy my first house from my parents. Small house in a decent area. Tenant pays $500 a month to my dad and I can buy the house from my dad for around $40.000,00 (he´s kind of tired of handling tenants, etc.) so I can make the proposal.

**To sum up:** As you may see, I have some options for my next steps but I don’t know how can I start creating passive income from the money left every month. I don’t know If living on this good apartment is a good idea (we love it, it's close to the job, Gym, Pool, everything, its good for our mental health on our high-stress jobs that's a point to consider). **I don’t know if I should sell the apartment and get this $90.000 (paying the 120k of debt to the bank)**  to work for me on small rental properties, etc. It´s kind of hard to see it that way because this is my home and I have to give up on that. On my country interest rates go around 9% a year and the DP to buy any property is around 20% on a 30 Years mortgage.

Any thoughts?

1933,0,"I'm slowly getting into real estate investing through the purchasing of rental properties (no commercial or large properties). It's been a learning curve but I'm enjoying it. One thing that I'd like to do is protect myself and my personal assets in case something happens (and make it easier during tax season).

I have two questions that I've been trying to find answers for, but it seems like depends who you ask, the answers are a bit different:

1. Currently, all my properties are under my name. I've spoken to a few other investors and they've said that I should either get the properties under a separate LLC for each property or get umbrella insurance to protect myself just in case (or both if I have the money). After reading up on LLCs, the one thing that everyone mentions as a disadvantage is the fact that getting a lender would be much more difficult, as well as getting a low rate (even if I'm able to find one). Since I only have a handful of properties, I'm leaning more towards umbrella insurance. Does anyone have any experience with doing either method? If so, are there things I should look for or a way I should move forward with?
2. Since currently I'm using my personal bank accounts for everything, I was thinking that I should separate my personal and investment accounts and create a sperate bank/credit card account. When doing so, should I just open another account under my name or create a new business account under a new business/LLC that would collect the rent, expenses, etc.? Also, would it be enough to just create a credit card account to use for expenses and have the rent payments go into my bank account or should I also create a completely separate checking account to use? LLCs, umbrella insurance, and separation of assets/accounts for rental properties"

1939,0,"I have never bought a house before, but I am thinking of possibly buying a house in the bay area next year.

I am just browsing houses on Redfin and Zillow, but I can't really tell which property is a good property for me. My parents were realtors (in another country) and I am interested in architecture, so I was always interested in houses I have my standards, but I would find a property I like, only to later learn about problems with the house or the neighborhood when I ask about it online.

I will be reading more books on home-buying and real estate investment, but I think I need a good mentor, and a good buyer's agent.

Unfortunately, I have no friend who bought a house or is knowledgeable.

I've requested showing once on Zillow, and didn't like how they match an agent. They just randomly match an agent and lets me unmatch them if I'm not satisfied. (I'm not sure if I can re-match them later)

My agent ghosted on me because I was too early in the stage. (I am not pre-qualified for a mortgage)

I am an extremely careful buyer, even when I'm buying something small on Amazon. If I buy a house, I absolutely must have browsed many properties over at least a year, and talked to many people about it. Even when I search for an apartment, I usually take months.

For realtors, I want to talk with multiple realtors over a long period of time, getting advice and being shown multiple properties, so I can comparison shop and pick one who is honest, is trustworthy and can get me a good deal (including private listings, etc.)

Maybe I am being too picky, but I can't imagine spending 5x \~ 10x of my entire saving without such painstaking searching processes.

I know BiggerPockets is a platform for exactly this purpose, but it wasn't fantastic, and I've seen lots of guys here complaining about BP.

So here are my questions:

What's your experience in real estate investing/home-buying, and what specifically have you done in order to find the perfect agent (give their honest feedback and not always trying to make a deal), mentors, and the perfect house you want to live in for many many years?

What mistakes have you made in the process, and what do you wish you have done differently (or what did you do differently next time)? First-time buyer. How do I find a good agent?"

I bought a townhome and wondering viability of renting it out in the future (3.5 years from now). I'm probably missing a lot of things here, but it hardly seems any benefit after taxes rake me across the coals? Suppose the below facts:

* Purchase price: $228k ($40k attributable to land)
* Adjusted tax basis: $164k ((228k-40k) / 27.5)\*3.5 - I wouldn't start renting until 3.5 years in, so  \~$570/mo depreciation
* **5 yr rental income (1600/mo) - $96k**
* Deductions:
   * Depreciation: ($34k)
   * HOA (155/mo): ($9.3k)
   * Property tax / hazard (current amounts): ($17k)
   * Mortgage interest ($31k)
* **Net - 5 year rental income less deductions: $3.7k**

Now...configuring taxes:

* Sale price - $228k (assumed no appreciation)
* Adj tax basis: $164k - $34k = $129k
* Depreciation recapture - 22%: ($7.5k) = ($34k \* 22%)
* Capital Gains - 15%: 129k \* 15% = ($14k)
* Selling fees 6% - ($13.6k)
* O/s Morgage payoff: ($178k)
* **NET proceeds, Sale price less taxes/fees/mortgage payoff - $13.6k**

**Net cash proceeds after above of $13.6k? How wrong am I, and if not wrong, why is this a viable path for anybody?** Seems like a lot of risk for little payoff.. Perhaps I'm not computing my adjusted basis or something correctly?

2. I have a 812 credit score, 7 credit cards, but no history of loans. Always have paid for my cars in cash. Will this effect anything?

I could have refinanced to another  30-year fixed at a new low rate 9 months ago rather than the 15-year  fixed, and that would have enabled me to end up with a bit of cash flow  if I were to rent it out, since the total monthly payment would be lower  so I'd have some extra funds from the rent I'd get each month.  With  the 15-year fixed, my current total monthly payment (includes mortgage,  interest, property tax, insurance, and HOA dues) would be close to what  I'd charge for rent, so it would be roughly break-even.  Whether I  should have gone with the 30-year instead of going with the 15-year I  guess is a question that's too late to be asking now.  I just wanted not  to have a mortgage payment to worry about by the time I retire.  I  could revisit refinancing again if it makes sense and doesn't lead to a  long break-even point due to closing costs and what not.

So  at this point, would it be better to wait until I pay off the entire  mortgage balance (about $178K left) before renting out the condo, or  better to rent it out now, have someone else pay down the mortgage, and  buy and move into a house?  The prices of homes are on the high side  right now, but interest rates are low.  Chase Bank has a program that  would allow me to take out another mortgage provided I have a signed  rental contract on my current property.  I wouldn't have to show 2 years  of rental history on the unit before I can take out another mortgage.

Having  the mortgage balance all paid off before I rent out the condo would be  less stressful, and in the event that I run into issues like we see now  with the COVID-19 impact resulting in forbearance for renters, I  wouldn't be worried about months and months of a renter not paying their  rent due to financial difficulty and having to end up paying 2  mortgages each month.   I'd have a greater ability to ride out the  unforeseen when it comes to renting out the condo.

But I'm curious to know what your views or advice would be...  Thanks! Better to pay off mortgage before renting out property?"

I've been working and saving for some time, and have a decent amount saved up. Not a lot by any means, but my savings account has more money than ever, and I'm debt free. 



Because of my lifestyle, I travel quite a bit and dont plan on ""settling down"" for a while. However, I like the idea of having a permanent property that I own, and can hold onto for a while to either flip, or build on and then sell. 



I've know a few important things to keep in mind like making sure theres sewage/septic, water, and electricity hookups are available, making sure the annual taxes are affordable, and that the location is important because of things like flood or fire insurance. 



Besides that, I'm so new to this scene. Obviously I'll be doing more research on google and books and things like that, but this is one of my first stops. I'm hoping some of you more experienced investors and flippers can give me some advice that I wont really find on google.

2608,0,"I do a fair amount of flips, and we always have a builders risk policy in place for each property, but we've never actually filed a claim.  long story short...our current project had a tree fall on it during a storm, literally 3 days after a $12k roof was done. There is a decent amount of damage, certainly enough to warrant paying our $2500 deductible.  

We filed the claim and were assigned an adjuster. A different ""field adjuster"" came out to look at the property. He got pretty defensive when we were pointing out the damage. The house wasn't renovated yet, but a lot that we were not going to renovate was damaged (couple skylights, a lot of drywall, some framing around the skylights, a section of flooring etc). He had us submit our budget and some invoices for the roof work.

The was all a couple weeks ago and its been pretty much radio silence since. When I call they just say that the inspection report has not been submitted yet.

I am a 23 year old male. Currently employed making $58,000/year (though currently cut 20% due to COVID) with room for upward growth if I so choose. I hold no debt of any kind. Current net worth of ~$80,000, with the majority ($55k in a Roth IRA and company sponsored 401k). I only have around $8000 cash savings, but have approximately $15,000 in other assets that could be liquidized very quickly should I need to. I currently live in a condo owned by my mom in a HCOL area (compared to surrounding areas in my state) with split rent, costing me $825/month.

For a while I have been thinking of purchasing some sort of rental property. However, recently I was turned onto the idea of ""house-hacking"" which I suppose means purchasing a duplex, triplex, etc with an 3.5% FHA loan, living within one unit for 1 year, while renting the other one or two, and ideally the rent from the other unit(s) will pay the mortgage. Of course, the idea is then to sort of continue and build on this year after year. 

I am hoping some of you can offer any advice, instruction, ""need-to-know info"", etc. that could help me out. Is this a good option?

3387,0,"This is kind of a hybrid /r/realestateinvesting and /r/financialindependence question, so posting this in both places.  I ""retired"" early a few years ago in my mid-30s.  My wife didn't retire but switched to a more fulfilling/lower paying career.  I've been investing in real estate...initially just in Notes but have gotten more into rentals the last year or so.  Since we no longer have W2 income it's been a balancing act to keep our DTI under 50%.  We also plan on upgrading to a new primary residence next spring and I want to take advantage of the low interest rates on primary homes.  We have plenty of assets but less income.  I'm in the process of buying a couple properties cash which should help that (though lower our ROI vs if we had financed) but I'm looking at other creative ways to improve the DTI.  

My wife has both a Roth IRA and a Traditional IRA from her working days invested in stocks.  I have a Self-Directed traditional IRA that I've used for Notes.  That account in particular earns 10-12% per year so would be nice to get ""credit"" for some of that income towards future mortgages even if it results in some taxes, so I'm starting to research some strategies.  

I believe a 72t distribution should count towards our DTI by most lenders since it would be set up as reliable regular planned distributions.  The downsides of that approach would be that it's complicated to set up, the interest rate that determines what distributions you can take is really low right now due to COVID, and you can't really change your mind and stop the distributions later.  

This brings me to the Roth Conversion ladder where we would annually convert a certain portion of our Traditional IRA to Roth, and then after 5 years can withdraw that money from the Roth.  Would the act of converting the money to Roth be ""income"" right away in year 1 as far as a mortgage underwriter is concerned, or would only the distribution/withdrawal from the Roth starting after year 5 be considered ""income"".  Either way, how would we prove it will be regular income going forward to a lender?  Would taking distributions from my wife's existing Roth help with that as we wait the 5 years to withdraw any newly converted money? Roth Conversion Ladder and DTI (Debt-to-Income Ratio)"

Federal Housing Administration mortgages -- the affordable path to homeownership for many first-time buyers, minorities and low-income Americans -- now have the highest delinquency rate in at least four decades.

The share of late FHA loans rose to almost 16% in the second quarter, up from about 9.7% in the previous three months and the highest level in records dating back to 1979, the Mortgage Bankers Association said Monday. The delinquency rate for conventional loans, by comparison, was 6.7%.

Millions of Americans stopped paying their mortgages after losing jobs in the coronavirus crisis. Those on the lower end of the income scale are most likely to have FHA loans, which allow borrowers with shaky credit to buy homes with small down payments.

For now, most of them are protected from foreclosure by the federal forbearance program, in which borrowers with pandemic-related hardships can delay payments for as much as a year without penalty. As of Aug. 9, about 3.6 million homeowners were in forbearance, representing 7.2% of loans, the MBA said in a separate report. The share has decreased for nine straight weeks.

U.S. Virus Relief Set to Vanish in Series of Fiscal Cliffs

Housing has held up better than expected in an otherwise shaky economy, with record-low mortgage rates fueling sales of both new and previously owned houses. With job losses mounting and Congress slow to act on a fresh stimulus package, that momentum could be threatened.

New Jersey had the highest FHA delinquency rate, at 20%. The state also had the biggest increase in the overall late-payment rate, jumping to 11% in the second quarter from 4.7%. Following were Nevada, New York, Florida and Hawaii -- all states with a high proportion of leisure and hospitality jobs that were especially hard-hit by the pandemic, the MBA said.

But the current spike in delinquencies is different from the Great Recession, thanks in part to years of home-price gains and equity accumulation, according to Marina Walsh, vice president of industry analysis for the bankers group.

3821,0,"Hello! I’m looking to buy my first-ever home and turn it into a rental property but would love some advice — I learned what the word “turnkey” meant yesterday so bear with me. 

Here’s my story:

My partner and I rent an apartment in one of the most expensive cities in the US. Our rent was affordable when we both worked but my SO lost his job when COVID hit. Our lease ends in October and though we love this apartment and this city, our landlords refuse to lower rent or give us a month to month lease.

There’s a vacation town about 2 hours outside of the city where my SO’s dad just bought a cheap cabin. I’ve seen several listings for around $200K — many with redone kitchens, bathrooms, multiple bedrooms!

Our plan: 

We would live in this home ourselves for about a year and a half with the goal of moving back to a city and turning it into a vacation rental. 

From my own research, it seems AirBNBs average at about $260 per night, but since our house will be under market value, I’m projecting we’ll get about $200 per night. 

Estimating yearly operating expenses will cost around $18,000 (mortgage, taxes, HOA, Internet, etc) and without taking into account first-year expenses, here’s a breakdown of what we could get, depending on occupancy:

39% occupancy @ $200 per night: $28,400
10% for property manager: $2,840
10% for capital improvements savings: $2,840
Net operating income: $4,720
ROI: 2.3% LOL for $200K house

60% occupancy @$200 per night: $43,800
10% for property manager: $4,380
10% for capital improvement savings: $4,380
Net operating income: $17,040
ROI: 8.5% for $200K house

See how occupancy makes a huge difference! What’s the most reliable way to estimate that percentage?

Also, is this in general a horrible idea? We have no interest in buying a “first” home (we prefer flexibility) but would love to have a vacation home in the country. It’s also hard to stomach signing a lease in a city that might be in lockdown for another year 😭 Best way to find occupancy rate?"

3824,0,"Hello,

I'm looking at buying my first apartment for rental purposes. Normally I just invest in the stock market, but I'd like to diversify a bit.

So I found an apartment I like, local to me. It's in great shape (built in 2009 so basically the latest building standards and energy ratings). All numbers below in DKK.

Apartment cost: **3 000 000**

Yearly property taxes: **60 000**

Expected yearly rent: **150 000** + utilities (paid by the tenant)

Tax on rent profit: **52%**

Tax on final sale profit: **52%** (I think)

I'm planning to put **20%** (**600 000**) down to avoid a bank loan. This leaves a mortgage (30 year, 1%) of approximately **92 520** per year. A part of that is tax deductible but let's ignore that for now.

So I take **150 000** - **60 000** (property taxes) - **92 520** (mortgage) = **-2 520**

So from day 1, I'm losing money each year. This is ... not what I'm used to. But fine, I read that this can happen. 

So now let's say I put more down than 20%. Now I put down 100%, so there's no mortgage.

I put down **3 000 000** and each year I take **150 000** - **60 000** = **90 000** profit

I pay tax on that profit leaving me with **43 200**

So my **3 000 000** investment products a total of **1.44%** in profit each year, even when the property is paid off. That's ridiculously low. And that doesn't even count the work and lack of liquidity involved in renting compared to the stock market. And I've ignored property insurance. And I've ignored the possibility of a period with no renter.

So what am I doing wrong? This seems impossibly bad. It sounds like this is ONLY good if I'm speculating that the housing market also rises quite substantially. In which case I may as well buy (and enjoy) a bigger house for myself and just invest in the stock market. Am I calculating something wrong? Can someone more experienced please sanity check this?"

The second meeting was today with the Common Council and I watched the live-stream on their Facebook page.  The change was denied, with some councilpersons reporting they'd gotten phone calls requesting it stay as single-family from people in that neighborhood....I have no idea if that is true or just politics.  One person who spoke at the meeting (city-planner???) said that if the status was denied, nothing would really change at the property.  They would not kick out any tenants or demand the property be converted back to single-family, and we'd still be able to get new tenants in the future.  They just wouldn't officially endorse it as multifamily.

I really like everything else about the property.  Fully occupied with tenants who have all been there at least a year with leases all renewed into 2021.  We had agreed on $125K and it would bring in over $2K per month in rents.  Roof was just replaced and there doesn't seem to be a ton of deferred maintenance I'd have to take care of right away.  

The obvious downside with the zoning as-is are the following:  I'd need to pay cash which would lower my ROI (but increase my cashflow).  If the property burns down and needs to be rebuilt, insurance would pay for a single-family home to be rebuilt...not another 4-plex.  This seems like a risk worth taking as I think the single-family would be worth about the same and I'd be able to sell it easily.  The big risk is that the local government suddenly decides to get more strict and demands the home be converted back to single-family.  There's no indication of that happening and it seems like these non-conforming homes are pretty common in the area, but things can change.  

I've already changed my mind 10 times this evening on if I should pursue a lower cash offer.  Would you still try to acquire this property if the price was right, or just stay the hell away?  I'm not sure what a hypothetical cost to convert back to single family would be....but I could do some more research and factor that into the offer. Illegal Non-Conforming 4-Plex, worth a lowball cash offer?"

She makes juuust shy of 3x the rent at her 2 jobs, but as part of her divorce, wants me to consider a child support arrangement with the father of the kids that became effective in June. The arrangement looks like it was typed up in Word by someone who's never typed a letter before, and is only notarized. No judge signature or reference to a court case. I don't know how normal that is. One of her 2 jobs lists a different supervisor, but out of curiosity, I pulled up the LLC, and it's registered to...her realtor. Her rental history is...crashing with her realtor for the last 2 years.
* Young couple that originally contacted my realtor asking if it's even worth seeing the place with their sub-500 credit scores that are ""just because of medical debt."" They qualify on income, but again, doing my own sleuthing, the courts are no fans of them. Nothing particularly violent, but they have a couple of DWIs and driving on a suspended license, they skipped on their court dates and were rewarded with bench warrants, and a shitload of fines that are now in collections. They seem like nice people, but they've already misrepresented why they're in hock (IMO).
* A family that qualifies on income, but has two adult children and an elderly relative living with them for a total of 5 people. This is a 1300sf 3 bed 1 bath home. That's already a lot of activity. They also want to bring their 3 dogs that average 45 lbs.

I'd appreciate any additional insight or advice. I don't know if we'll get more applications yet, but unfortunately I think I have to accept that this neighborhood isn't where some stockbroker or software engineer is going to be looking for a place. I'm not strictly opposed to any of these tenants, they just all have *just* enough suspicion in their backgrounds that make me wonder if renting to them is wise.

I’m looking into “buying”, with the support of parents, a Co-Op apartment in the outskirts of Chicago. The building is near a major college campus. The current “owner” is asking for $50k cash. I am interested in paying in full, but hesitant on the idea of a Co-Op. I’ve been eyeing a few condos in the highly sought after north side of the city (i.e Lakeview, Lincoln Park, Bucktown, Uptown, etc) but quite expensive. Many of these condos are recommending $50k (20%) as down payment. No surprise there. Still leaving for a fairly high mortgage payment plus hefty HOA fees.

With the Co-Op, I would pay the $50k so no monthly mortgage payments but will still have to pay for HOA fees as expected. My concerns with this Co-Op in Chicago,or in general:

1. Do these co-op apartments/ units have strong resale value?
2. If purchased, and decide to sell later, would I even get my money back?
3. These types of living situations  are not your typical condo, what is the benefit?

5246,0,"Hi all,

I would love your input, as I am personally confused about how to best think about this situation, and as I mentioned, a few very experienced mentors of mine disagree about the best move.

As a necessary preface, my goal is to maximize profit over the next 20 years more than to mitigate risk at this point. I’m OK with being leveraged.

Situation:
 - I have $250,000 of equity in a $400,000 single family rental house in Nashville Tennessee.
- It rents for 2400 per month
- It is very safe to assume 5% annual appreciation over the next 20 years. It is in a hotspot of Nashville which has seen steady 6% annual appreciation over the past 40 years
- taxes, insurance, mortgage, and management are 1800/mo

The issue is that the $250,000 in equity is going unused. 

I cannot figure out how to best think about whether it’s best to sell it and 1031 or keep renting and cash out refi.

Either way, I would use the extracted money as a 25% down payment on a MFH. I have identified plenty that will cash flow nicely. But assuming the new property would be the same in both circumstances (in other words, saying “all else equal”) not sure how to think about whether to 1031 or cash out refi.

Found it by doing what I've been doing.  Look daily on Redfin.  Research anything that looks plausible, offer when it meets my criteria.  This one did - but it was a bit scary.  Double the price I've been paying per unit.  Rents and location justify it, but I still had to talk myself into ""levelling up"" my price by double.  But, numbers don't lie.

Put in a low-ball offer to sweeten the pot even more, but others offered as well.  Ultimately, went back to asking price, but the numbers still work.

5757,0,"I was interested in purchasing property in a development in PA that was surrounds a lake, all property off lake gets a boat slip at their marina. I assume most sales were for vacation homes, although some were probably thinking of moving in as a primary residence.  There are about 100 parcels in the development and most were sold ten years ago by the developer although the developer is still selling the remaining few they still own. When I looked at the development this week, most of the parcels had not yet been built on and the initial lot pricing by the developer ten years ago (and the same price  being asked now) is double what people are asking for their lots at resale. I assume the developer is trying to artificially maintain values by not undercutting third party sales.

While I can understand some people buying and holding for the future, I can not understand why half the lots were never built on and those that are now for sale are willing to accept half what they paid ten years ago just to get out of the deal.

Taxes are low, especially on an undeveloped lot, and HOA fees are a few hundred dollars a year which includes a boat slip.

What am I missing? I feel like there's something going on that owners know and I'm unaware of. I'd love to be able to call someone and just ask, what the heck's going on over there and why are so few lots built on and others being sold for half what they paid ten years ago.

I'm not familiar with unsuccessful developments that don't take off. Usually if a poor developer fails, they move on, sell out, and a new developer fixes the mess. Here, it's been a decade and while the developer certainly made money on selling the initial lots, something just does not add up. What are the usual reasons people don't build on a lot they bought so long ago, its not just money since half have not built on their lots. Why would property at a development sit idle?"
5758,0,"Hey friends,

I’m a complete noob to real estate investing but was thinking about ways to match up i) property owners unable to make mortgage payments due to layoffs (if resident) or vacancies (if landlord) and ii) people (like myself) who currently rent but have spare cash flow from their job, in a way that is BENEFICIAL for people in i) and ii) at the expense of banks.

My key assumption is that if people in group i) cannot make mortgage payments, the bank disproportionately benefits by 1) foreclosing the house 2) still getting the full mortgage back via permissory note 3) having received a lot of upfront interest payments in the beginning of the mortgage term.

The idea would be to set up a system to bypass the bank foreclosing, getting new investors (group ii) ) to assume the mortgage and benefit from the mortgage being partly paid off.

A challenge to this idea that I’m unsure about is whether people in group ii) would benefit enough by assuming the mortgage, or if they should just get their own mortgage in a market with lower prices and low interest rates.

What do you think about this? Business idea - mortgage assumption during recession"
5759,0,"Hi all, new to this, and I've been kicking around an idea and I cant find a ton of information on it so I figured I would see if someone here can point me in the right direction.

I am currently about 8 months away from having my current home paid off and being debt free. 

The rough plan is this..
-Pay off home.


- Once all of that dust settles take out a HELOC on my home, to purchase a rental property (from what I can tell Helocs carry lower interest rates than trying to get a mortgage on an investment)


-Form LLC to own said rental property, and have all cash flow into LLC account so it is not seen as income by me directly. 


-Assuming cash flow positive, let all excess money build into the LLC account, and possibly add my own funds to it to achieve 8-10k emergency fund for property. 


-Once the 8-10k emergency fund is built for the property, all extra cash will be put against the principle of the loan until it is paid off. 

-repeat?


The basic idea is that with my home paid for, I can use the equity in it to basically purchase a rental property that will pay for its self and I would not come out of pocket for it. 

Does this make any sense or am I off my rocker completely?

South of the UK, we can buy a bigger house for ~100k more than our current house and sell our current house, or, should we look at buying a slightly smaller (but still bigger) house and keeping our current house and renting it out. We're talking in the 200k to 350k range for any of these houses here.

1st option is what we're leaning towards since we do need more room than our current house offers, but 2nd option is we could probably make do with a smaller upgrade and also start on the property investing ladder by renting our current house out.

5772,0,"Hello investors, I'm looking for a way to both help my dad out while also taking an advantage of a possible investment opportunity, but I don't know if it's worth the risk.

My dad is looking to sell his house in TX in a fairly high-value area. He fully owns it and only pays property taxes. He needs the income from it because he's retired and is unable to access his offshore retirement savings due to financial crisis/political instability. I estimate the house could sell for $350-400k easily.

This is where it gets murky. Over 20 years ago he took this 1500sqft house I grew up in and added an additional 800sqft himself (he was a civil engineer), including a large back deck and an additional shed. I recently discovered that he never reported this to the appraisal office, nor have they found out about it all this time. How do I help him right this wrong? Is it possible for him to sell the house through a realtor without dealing with that first? Won't any potential buyer inherit the problem? Does he have the option of selling by owner?

This is where I come in. He's suggested he would transfer the deed to me and I take out a second mortgage to buy them a smaller house in the outskirts of the city. I would also potentially remodel and rent out the old house and use that rental income to pay the mortgage of the new house. This seems like an opportunity because I'd effectively be buying a high value property at the cost of a low value one. But is it worth the risk with the property taxes? Would I then inherit his problem and fix it by reporting the additional sqft to the appraisal office?

6304,0,"  Hi All - Me and my partner(Tom) have been investing together for some time. We started a new ABC LLC with a common friend(John) and got a deal under contract due on financing(75% LTV). Come to find out lenders had a problem with John because he is putting in 60%($100,000) of the initial investment, no landlord experience and he is not a US citizen even though he lives here on E2 visa and has been investing through his US based XYZ LLC.

So Tom and I re did the ABC LLC with just us as the members of the LLC and lenders were fine with that. We are closing in a few weeks.

Question - How do we contract with John now for the initial investment? 

1 Can't bring John on as a member of the ABC LLC since lenders will have a problem with that when they find out. **Can our ABC LLC do a limited partnership with XYZ LLC without raising flags with the lender?**

2 We can do an interest only promissory note like (John get x% on the capital) but John had agreed to 54% equity in the original deal and all 3 of us would like to do a promissory note with profit and loss sharing, where John gets amount equivalent of 54% of total cash flow calculated end of each year + 54% of the mortgage principal pay down at the end of the term(lets say 3 years)

eg - if the cash flow is $10,000 every year(for simplicity), John gets $5,400 every year. And at the end of the term, lets say total principal paid towards the mortgage is $20,000, then John gets $10,800 once. 

So John's total return is $5,400 X 3  +  $10,800 = $27,000  (roughly &gt;9% because cash flow will ideally increase every year)

I recently purchased my first property in the Midwest and have been living in it for about 9 months. It’s a condo in a nice part of my city. My idea buying it was that it would be easy to rent out and I could move on to other properties and rent it out as an investment after. I got a 15 year loan and figured it could be a passive investment tool eventually.

Since then I’ve saved up enough to make a down payment on a similarly priced property. I think this condo will prove a valuable and stable investment but I’m realizing that In my city houses can actually make even better investments (by the numbers and considering HOA fees).

Considering I got the 15 year loan on the first property I might end up paying $100-200 a month more for it than rental income would be from it ($1350 a month vs $1200 a month renting). I mostly bought it because I know it will be safe (difficult to damage and easy to rent).

I don’t quite have enough saved for a second property yet, but I was wondering what everyone’s experience has been and what they would recommend timing wise? What is it like getting a loan on a second property? Any expected pitfalls from renting properties out?

I've noticed something fairly recently that has been kinda bothering me. Being on biggerpockets and seeing how many people who truly have ZERO clue as to what they are talking about, then passing that info off as if they are experts. 

I'm kinda done with reading biggerpockets as a whole. It seems like a lot of amateurs and mom and pops who stick there 2 cents into anything they possibly can. It's a good place to start out for some initial things but man, I've never seen people need this much correcting. 


A good example. New wholesaler asks questions regarding holding costs, closing costs, and rehab cost. A bunch of people start throwing opinions in. Who might I add have NEVER wholesaled a property and it isn't until the 3rd or 4th page where another wholesaler steps in and gives legit info. You have to many of the small time investors with large ego's giving what is in essence unsolicited advice/opinion. 

I've seen both very new fix and flippers and people who dont even do rehabs try telling a new wholesaler it's his/her problem to add up expenses that are not even the wholesalers responsibility....


To put it lightly, I wouldnt take advice from someone in there 60's only making 4k a month from real estate using buy and hold methods. Nothing wrong with it but people need to stay in there own damn lane. 

I want anyone who reads this and is going into wholesaling to know this. 

1. If your customer tries to dictate how much you make or how you conduct business....end the deal with them and find someone worthwhile. 

2. HOLDING AND CLOSING COSTS ARE NOT YOUR RESPONSIBILTY IT IS THE END BUYERS!!!

3. Structure how you are going to do EMD payments on your terms....not others. 

4. Do not take advice from people who have never done a single deal and armchair quarterback. 

5. Rehab costs are not your problem. Give a rough estimate with a very simple formula of looks×price per sqft to make an easy transaction. You dont need to be specific. You are not a GC or the person doing the rehabbing...that is there due dilligance to figure out their  own true cost. 

6. It is not your job to make sure the end buyers profit margins are correct and hand hold them. If they cant figure it out for themselves, they are not worth your time. They are there to get the property from you and get it assigned to them.  Use a simple formula and move on.

Information: live in Canada; never purchased a home before.

My dad and I are looking to buy a multi family property where I would live in one unit and manage the property.

Now, our intention was for us to split it in half, so I have 50% and he has 50%. I want to have equity in it. Now, he plans to own this property via his holding company. 

We spoke with our accountant, we are setting up a meeting with him shortly to further discuss, and mentioned this idea to him and his first concern was since I never purchased a home before I would forfeit my first-time homeowners tax credit. 

Currently, in Canada, we can get an additional 10% from the govt for a down payment that is to be repaid when the home is sold. Additionally, we can draw from our RRSPs and use it tax free to purchase your first home (I believe it is to be paid back over X amount of years). I would lose this benefit, I am assuming, by owning an investment property?

As our accountant pointed out, at the end of the day, the property would eventually come into my possession (along with my sisters and mom).

Is there a point for me to be building equity alongside my dad? Or should I just live in it rent free and manage the property (yes, I am interested in self-management; this is our test pilot into REI), and not worry about not having equity in the property. 

Are there alternative routes to this type of investment?

However, I've noticed that a) a lot of mid or small sized towns/cities do not have super uniform or reliable data, so there are some blank spots in my 'rubric' and b) I don't really know for sure how heavily I should weigh each category.  Is weather really *all* that important? People live here and seem to like it.  Is having a major airport within an hour *really* a deal-breaker?  Maybe I don't mind connections...but then again, maybe that airport facilitates growth and appreciation and therefore should be a deal-breaker.  What's the sweet spot in economic growth? etc. etc.

6880,0,"I have been looking to buy a rental lately and when looking at a SFH I noticed that it does not really make sense price wise above the $150k range, that is if cash flow is your goal and assuming you are leveraging with 20% down.

Or another way of saying what I mean is once you go above the $150k range, the 1% rule seems to go away.

There was one article that I cannot recall to find atm, but it was mentioning how some areas like LA a $800k+ home rents for $3k, like 1/3% of the purchase price.

Even in other cities, like randomly looking at SLC I see a SFH for $750k. Expected rent is 2600. Why would anyone buy this home simply other than people who intend to live there. Even for those who want there forever home, they could rent it for so much cheaper.

I understand once its paid off owning is way cheaper than renting. But if I had the ability to buy a $750k home, I would much rather invest it so I could hopefully have my dividends pay for my rent rather than paying a mortgage monthly....

The house is an older neighborhood and was purchased 63 years ago by my father.  Some of the family wants to sell, some want to turn it into a rental property.  It is 2-story with 7 bedrooms and 2 bathroom, regular kitchen dining / family room with a decent yard for the East Bay.  I am not interested in being business partners with some of my family members so I vote to sell.

So as the title says, what value will a real estate agent bring to a seller other than marketing the home?  Wouldn't the buyer and buyer's agent be interested in doing all of the inspections and title company be responsible for pulling any lien information on the home to make sure the estate has the legal right to sell the home?

6885,0,"Looking for other owner-operator or self-managing MF investors to share how they structure their self management. We have properties each in their own ownership entity (ie, A-G) and one separate entity (ie. Z) that is a fractional owner of those entities.

I've been doing a lot of research and reading some books regarding buying a rental property. I'm in the NYC area, but I'm most likely going to get something in the midwest. 

The thing that is really worrying me at this point is getting hit with some pricey CapEx stuff that destroys my returns. Like a new roof, HVAC, etc. I plan to have sufficient cash reserves to handle anything, I'm just worried from a return perspective. 

I found a pretty good discussion and a blog post which are linked below. 

My take away from my research is that it's best to get an itemized list of all potential CapEx stuff and make an age/cost estimate for every one. 

Do you guys do this? Is this something you can do based upon an inspection report? Is it really just a roll of the dice to a large degree?

7481,0," So background: I'm still pretty new to this whole real estate investing thing. I have a 2 family currently that I purchased last year. I'm cash flowing about $900 positive per month on it after all expenses. 

 I really want a second property but don't have a lot of money to put down. There's a couple properties about an hour from me with motivated sellers, and the same agent for both. I've asked the agent to represent me on the properties, which is legal in my state. I figure the extra motivation to close the deals will help for the double commision he'll get.

 The seller for the five unit property is interested in Seller Financing the entire deal, that's as far as we've got so far. The seller of the 7 unit said no at first, but is now willing to consider it after the agent talked to him more. I go and see both properties on Tuesday. Both have been on the market for over a year.

 The cash flow is high enough on each, my current plan is to see if I can seller finance the down payment on the 7 unit property and finance the remainder with my bank. I spoke with the bank already and they said they are definitely willing to do this. The owner owes nothing on the property so I feel like this is a possible option.

 The 5 unit needs more work but is half the price, so I'd probably be looking to seller finance the entire purchase with a balloon. Offer under what they are asking, fix the place up and refinance in a couple years to pay the seller off. 

Anyway, I'm just looking for some general advice. Pitfalls to avoid, stupid things to not fall into, etc. I'm already planning to request copies of the tenants leases and the cash flow for the properties so I can verify it myself.

On one hand, it's possible that bc of covid, there will be an influx of distressed or non-performing notes that hit the market. On the other hand, ppl losing their jobs might mean that they will not be able to make a new payment structure. Plus, laws may make evictions impossible for many months.

8115,0,"Thanks for your time in reading the post! I’m a 25yr old newbie here looking to make a move in the near term and want to cultivate a solid understanding of what my drivers of profitability will be before doing so. I’m going to quickly go through these for my own edification so please confirm and comment if you have anything to add!

Based on my understanding the two core drivers of growth are: (1) cash flow and (2) appreciation. If we look at (1) cash flow on the revenue side we can either (1b) increase rents or unlock additional revenue by charging for ancillary things like parking, laundry, etc. On the Expenses side, we could increase cash flow by  (1b) looking for opportunities to shift expenses to the tenants (e.g. utilities, lawn care, etc.).

The crux of my question comes as I think about number 2: appreciation. My understanding is that appreciation is one of the strongest drivers of returns. And asset appreciation can either come as a result of (2a) the market organically increasing or (2b) forcing appreciation through renovation. 

All in all these are what I’ve identified as my four levers of profitability. What did I miss?

Like any investor, I want to be able to control as much of my return as possible—I want to mitigate how much I’m beholden to market rents and organic market appreciation. So looking at (2b), forced appreciation, what are some of the renovations I could do to most effectively force returns on the asset?

The confusion now comes when close friends and family now want to partner and ""invest"" with me.  I think I could make something make sense easily treating those folks as private lenders but more I talk to them, most want to have an equity split in properties with me and share.  There's anywhere from 5-10 ""investors"" that are asking me to do something with their money.

I'll admit that it's flattering that people trust me and I want to do what's good for everyone, but I'm a bit confused on the best way to utilize their investment and also, how to scale an operation like this.  If capital is no longer the biggest constraint, it would be nice to focus on networking, deal finding &amp; analysis I would assume.  Also, management becomes a huge concern as I feel like I'm pretty close to my limit on what I can do from a management capacity standpoint.

Any advice on how I can (in this order of importance):

1. Create a win-win scenario for myself &amp; investors from an equity split perspective
2. Scale up quickly but safely
3. Transition to a property / portfolio manager without killing my bottom line too much 
4. Structure my business for liability protection, growth and ease of management

8117,0,"Hey! So I'm starting to get into wholesaling with a friend and as a beginner, I want to make sure I dot all my i's and cross all my t's.

How do I go about writing a contract when I offer to buy someone's house in cash? Obviously I want an inspection period where I can back out (incase I don't find a buyer). Similarly, how do I go about writing a contract to transfer the ownership of the first contract to the investor who's a cash buyer?

My assumption is that I need a real estate lawyer to draft up some sample templates for me, but is there an easier way where I can find a template online?

8118,0,"**TL;DR Tenant of 5 years who is likely a hoarder, won't remove their stuff from the deck. What can I do?**

My parents and I own a multifamily home that we live in and rent out the first floor to tenants. They've been there for a few years now. No issues for the most part, occasionally they have to be reminded to pay the rent as they seem forgetful of it every once in a while. Besides that, they're clearly hoarders as the inside of the apartment is FULL of stuff (which honestly worries me as a fire hazard as well).

My current concern is that we have a front patio/porch that has both doors for the first and second floor in the front of the house. My family doesn't put anything on the porch. About a year and a half ago, the tenant asked if they can do some gardening in the small patch of lawn we have. My father allowed them since he wasn't using it. That translated to the tenants slowly putting stuff on the garden and then putting stuff on the patio. My parents didn't think much of it at the time and relations with the tenants were good.

The tenants kept putting more and more stuff out on the porch to the point that it's full of clutter, a small table, chairs, A LOT of smaller things, plants, plants hanging off the ceiling (never told them they could drill in the wood), plants hanging off the ledges. Long story short, it's gotten WAY out of hand. On top of it, the paint has started to chip from the close contact of the plants exposing the raw wood. My father wants them to remove their stuff so he can repaint it all and he feels like the tenants are taking advantage of his good nature and quite frankly, that's not part of the rental agreement.

I've notified the tenants once in November, then again in January to remove the clutter by the end of February, asking very politely and giving them plenty of time. I messaged them again on Sunday asking to please clear the deck because my parents are planning on scraping the ceiling and floor and repainting it. No response from them.

I am writing to them tomorrow again in a more stern tone and my father is planning to just move their stuff off the porch if they don't take it off. So far it's been 2 days since I sent the message (the THIRD MESSAGE about this) and they haven't moved ANYTHING. Which leads me to believe they have no intention of moving it. Obviously this is annoying because it's our house and they're dictating how they treat areas of it that they are not paying for.

My father is planning to move the things off and tell them he doesn't want it back on the porch. If they put it back he's just going to throw it on the sidewalk whether it breaks none of his concern.

Obviously it's a pandemic outside and there's a moratorium for evictions but my father doesn't even care about them stiffing us for rent for the next two months if that's what it takes. He wants to stand his ground and I see his point, he worked his ass off for 10 years saving up pennies to put a down payment on a home and this is how these tenants are treating it.

2) Get a decent paying job - I don't know if right out of college I'll find a job and make $50k a year, hopefully it'll be at least $40k. If I'm an accountant I'll have my own private practice or accounting firm on the side. 

3) Buy my first house/Real estate investment - Hopefully I'll be able save over $20k for a down payment and fees. I should have good credit around this time. If I live in this house for a couple years or maybe 4, I can take out equity to help me buy an apartment building or multi-family property with the money in my savings.

I'm going to get my net worth up and qualify to invest in franchises such as McDonald's or burger King. Besides my accounting firm, I'm going to have my own business I'm not totally sure what type of business but I know I will start one.

The area is a C-level area, it is only a few houses away from my other houses, but these are not nice homes and people here generally do not have cash to buy.



House is foreclosed and is on a main road. If the house was NOT on a main road and was financeable, it would probably be worth $135k. Because of the main road, I would knock it down to $115k. The house is also next door to a gas station so it cannot use any homebuyer loans (within 1000ft of a hazardous material). Would knock it down to about $100k because of the gas station.


The house was listed at $135k 200 days ago, is now down to $100k.


The detached garage is completely caved in, needs a new platform too, and is making the home un-financeable. (Along with a bunch of little bullshit things, but those are nbd)


So this narrows the buying pool to people who can buy in cash. I was planning on offering $60k and I called the agent to ask about the place and he said, “I keep seeing offers of $60k coming in but the Fannie Mae won’t budge, every time I get a $60k offer I show it to them and try to explain that you can’t sell a home like this for cash.” before I even said $60k.



So I offer my $60k and it get rejected, shocker.



The agent is telling me how frustrated he is with it because he has to check on it every week and it is a waste and that he just wants to make the sale.



I was wondering, does anyone have any experience getting the government to change their prices? Or should I just keep throwing in $61k (to beat out those other $60k offers lol) and hope that eventually they will fall that low?

Any advice is much appreciated! Anyone have luck going from a SFH to a Multi for second property?"
9443,0,"Background: It's a studio co-op in a ""prestigious"" area of Brooklyn. Beautiful neighborhood, lots of outdoor space. I'm confident the neighborhood will always be ""nice"" but if NYC as a whole goes down, certainly this neighborhood will be affected greatly as it's fairly central 

I bought it at $410,000 in early 2017, interest rate of 3.25%. Down payment of $160,000.

I put it on the market and recently received an all-cash offer of $384,000

I would be selling at a loss, which dissuades me from selling. However, my concern is that other than my retirement, emergency savings, and 11K in the stock market, a good chunk of my assets are tied into this studio. If my studio continues to depreciate with greater WFH adoption/people permanently leaving NYC, I can't imagine being stuck in a tiny studio for who knows how many years...

What are your thoughts? Should I sell my NYC studio co-op?"
9444,0,"I am fortunate to have a stable and decent paying remote job that allows me to live anywhere in the lower 48 states (and near an airport for business travel). I am early 30s, single, very mobile, and wanting to invest intelligently. Currently own my first property and researching my next target. 

My overall real estate plan is to buy another house or duplex under ~$300k range every 2-4yrs to live in, add curb appeal improvements as needed, then eventually rent out or sell. Aiming for at least 2 beds and 2 full baths to potentially rent the room out to lower costs. Rinse and repeat then have option to sell any remaining rental properties once they’ve really appreciated over time. I also like the idea of moving to different places every few years to start again and get to know the locality, assuming I don’t settle down permanently in one region and just grow my real estate portfolio locally. Planning on using a management firm to look after my rentals. 

Looking for small-to-mid sized urban areas with strong potential for long term growth and appreciation. Especially for cities that can become the next major Tier 3/4 economic player like what Austin, Denver, and Tampa have become. With my price range, I am mainly focusing on the Southeast region (NC, SC, GA, TN, FL) with LCOL towns and cities primed for attracting retirees, employment, young professionals and families; but also open to all regions in the US to research into. For those who have a similar strategy, hoping we can all share “hot tips” for areas about to reach a flashpoint in the next 5-10yrs!

I have enough for 20% down for my price range, and emergency savings if the economy really goes for the worst. Starting to research and hunt for great deals especially if rates stay or get lower, and prices have fallen some due to the Covid pandemic. Here are my Top 5 areas I’m considering, any thoughts on the below for my next move?

- **Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill, NC**: 
This area is already a spoiled secret but can still find opportunities in the growing rural areas 30-45min outside of the Research Triangle Park. Soon will become a leading Tier 3 urban area in my opinion. *This is where I’m based now with my first investment property near downtown Durham. Just reached 2yr ownership and have already built a nice estimate ROI. Have an interested party lined up to start renting already. May stay in the RDU area if I find another great deal to buy next.*

- **Savannah GA - Hilton Head Island - Beaufort SC**: 
Once seen as just a sleepy retirement or tourist/golfing destination, I think this region has started growing exponentially with recent YoY leaps in population and housing. My older brother’s family relocated to HHI and lives in and rents out two properties, and currently building his third home in Beaufort to move into. Most of HHI is already developed and quite expensive but off the island, there’s been more developments and planned communities starting in the $200k range. My brother is starting to see more young professionals moving in as well the last few years, not just retirees. Very family friendly area and why I’m strongly looking into nearby downtown Savannah, GA. Able to find beautiful remodeled historic homes and fixer-uppers well under $300k. These types of historic and new colonial styled homes are often $1M+ in sister historic port city Charleston, SC. With the major shipping port, growing aerospace/defense industry, local SCAD and State universities, and “southern charm” seaside appeal, I think downtown Savannah is starting to catch up with Charleston in accelerated value and growth. 

- **Winston-Salem, Greensboro, High Point, NC**: 
Known as the “triad” (sister to RDU “triangle”), this urban region seems to mirror what Raleigh Durham was 20yrs ago. Winston Salem, similar to Durham, has beautiful old tobacco factory buildings repurposed into mixed use, but currently a high crime rate and void of a younger concentration (also like where Durham was 20yrs ago). Local education is strong with several good universities (Wake Forest, High Point, UNC-G, AT). Since the triad had a brain-drain with young professionals moving to the bigger cities as Big Tobacco became less of the anchoring industry, there are now active municipal and grant-supported efforts to attract research, medicine, and IT partnered by the universities. Banking also has regional presence due to nearby Charlotte. I think the biggest “hot tip” to the triad is its location between Raleigh and Charlotte, equally 1-1.5hr away on the I-40/85 corridor. Feels like the triad is the last big urban area in North Carolina primed to explode just like RDU, Charlotte, and Asheville. There are cheap under $100k historic homes in downtown Winston Salem and Greensboro getting snatched up for gentrification and remodeling. 

- **Jacksonville FL**:
Home value and population have dramatically increased YoY like other big southern cities, but jobs/construction have cooled off last 2 years. This temporary stunt lead to oversupply of affordable newly built homes under $300k. My thinking for investment is more long term, as JAX is already a Tier 4 city in terms of population, but seems to be the last large urban environment in Florida that has not yet matured into a big economic and luxury market player that the rest of Southern Florida has become. Don’t get me wrong....there’s still mansions worth several millions in JAX...but the city and its beaches haven’t garnered the same high status and wealth as Miami-Boca Raton, West Palm Beach, and now Tampa/Sarasota. I can see the long term potential especially as a large Atlantic seaside city. I also foresee positive job growth returning to JAX in the next business cycle, sandwiched between Atlanta and Miami. 

- **Chattanooga TN**:
Has attracted STEM and is now the “Gig City” of the world with some of the fastest internet connections. I still don’t hear too much about “Nooga” yet...but have the feeling it will will grow quickly and attracting national trending similar to Nashville as of late. So most real estate investors haven’t largely caught on just yet, but I’ve seen trending in buying and housing prices spike this year. Equidistant to Nashville, Knoxville, and Atlanta, this town seems ready  for a flashpoint. Situated at the foothills of the Appalachian mountains, this town is highly regarded to be family oriented and very safe. I can see it attracting the same active young professional crowd who enjoy the outdoors that Denver, Salt Lake City, and Colorado Springs get. Great prospects for real estate buying, # 2 under Nashville and above Raleigh Durham on PwC’s Real Estate 2020 report. (https://www.pwc.com/us/en/asset-management/real-estate/assets/pwc-emerging-trends-in-real-estate-2020.pdf)
 
*Smaller areas that I’m also considering:*

- **Fort Mill SC**:
Just south of banking capital Charlotte NC. Young professionals and families are relocating south of the border for the cheaper housing, lower taxes, gasoline, etc compared to NC. 

- **Greenville SC** 
The fastest growing market in SC and halfway point between major economic players Charlotte and Atlanta. Very family oriented and has attracted a trendy progressive vibe similar to Asheville and Austin. 

- **Columbia SC**:
For potential long term value, as the state capital and home to the flagship USC university. Higher crime rate and low industry but may benefit from SC’s overall growth trajectory. Currently not a valued proposition for employment...but maybe in another 10 years? May never become an “Austin” but maybe potential as the next Nashville or Birmingham? 

- **Cape Coral-Fort Meyers-Naples FL** 
Gulf-seaside area that caught national attention as of late. One of the highest increased rates in the state. Potential to become the next big luxury housing market player in south FL. Thinking it would be a great place to buy and rent to retirees.

I’m curious to know what the risk and costs of a bank pursuing you for occupancy fraud are. In other words, if you accept a loan requiring owner-occupancy (e.g. FHA 203k) and you sign documents outlining your intent to live in the property, what is the probability of them pursuing you and, if they do, what is the typical cost to resolve the situation or penalty? If you have relevant experience, please share for the group! 

Essentially, I’m looking to manage risk not unlike when people make the decision to go over the speed limit. You know the probability of getting pulled over and, even if you do, you also know the risk/cost of getting caught. And, you decide to speed anyway because the expected cost (I.e. the probability of getting caught multiplied by the cost of a speeding ticket) is so low you do it anyway.

Hi all, I’m considering making a big move on my primary residence and have several options before me. I’m hoping the brain trust here can help me see the up and downsides and direct me to some relevant resources. Thanks in advance, I know it’s a lot of text..

Background: My family lives in a paid off house in HCLA (Seattle) near the site of a site of a future light rail station (open 2022). Nearer the station apartments have been going up like crazy, our street has been recently up-zoned to 3 story residential commercial. Most re-development on similar streets tend towards townhouse/big box homes. We’re trying to move out of seattle to be closer to family. In that community we own a home that might be a little small for us but would be fine to live in for a few years. It is currently cash flowing $400 a month with great renters. My goal is to monetize the Seattle house to help enable a move, the problem is that I can’t find work in my field there without taking a 30% plus pay cut and doing less desirable work. Short term commuting would be an option while the Seattle house shakes out. I make about $65K a year and am in this fortunate position due to inheritance. My wife has higher earning potential but is focusing on being a mother right now. The job market where we want to move is terrible, and I’ve managed to specialize my job skills in a pretty small niche. I’d like to increase my income by leveraging the seattle house, or use it as a leap pad to flip houses. 

The house is paid off with a zestimate of $780K. We’ve received a cash offer of $850k through a broker. It’s a 3 bed 2 bath 1940s house with 1450Sft on a 4500Sft lot. It would be a fine rental if we were to keep it, needing a little work to get it ready and a new roof and paint in a few years it would rent for around 3k a month. If we did a lot more work we could probably sell on the market for above the 850K offer. 

Here are some options I’m considering but am open to anything: 

1. Take out a loan on the seattle house to buy a fix and flipper in our desired community and make that my full time job. I’ve done one (mostly) successful flip on weekends before I had a family, as well as lot of remodel work. I think I could make this option pay. It shouldn’t be hard to get around a 500K loan, which could be covered by renters in seattle. Downsides, leave a stable job, great health insurance, how to pay the mortgage on the second house while the flip is in process, my wife might stop working also because we’re trying to have a second kiddo. Then again, more family to help with childcare in our desired community. 
2. Sell the Seattle house and wrap the proceeds into a fix and flip as well as a new home for my family in our new community. Same downsides as before, but no loan payment. Other downsides, losing future appreciation of Seattle house. A bit of a stretch to buy two more houses. Tax implications?
3. Take out a loan on the Seattle house and redevelop the lot ourselves and then sell. Big box houses in our area seem to sell for $1.5 - $2.2. I don’t know how feasible this is. I don’t know how much capital one would need or how big of a lot you need to do townhomes. 
4. Partner with a neighbor or two to sell as a block. I think there is at least one neighbor who would consider this. The broker who I spoke with said this wouldn’t really change the offer from his developer, but I’d like to learn more about this. It seems like if a developer could get a bigger block of properties together, it would increase value. 

Any thoughts on this would be greatly appreciated, and better yet if anyone could direct me to some resources to learn more about how to do DD on the various options. I really don’t know much about the tax implications and the feasibility of redeveloping the seattle house either.  Thanks!

When I brought up the idea of real estate investing, my parents seemed to be extremely skeptical. They say that inveesting in real estate is impossible for me, due to the fact that mortgage is completely out of the question and that I am just a kid in the first place. 

They do have a point, but I still don't think this should stop me from figuring out what works! To clarify things, I absolutely do not expect to be investing in a 'grand property' and be racking in $10K every month or anything. Starting small and humble is key when treading new waters. 

If it's worth anything, I so far have managed to earn roughly $5K from online freelancing and errands for neighbors. I know this amount is probably not even able to have an impact, but in my mind, at least it's something.

Second home purchased at ~$900k, currently worth ~$1.1M. Owe $675k and recently refinanced for ~$3.5k/mo total payment. Currently house hack and AirBnB the basement suite for ~$2k/mo. Can rent long term for $4.5k/mo minimum.

Possible third home purchase for ~$1.3M with ADU and larger lot (for kid). Would pull $400k heloc from first property for down payment and rent ADU ($2k/mo) for additional income. Total monthly payment would be ~$7k/mo

However, that eviction moratorium expired on July 25, 2020. In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, states such as New York, California, Texas and Florida could experience the most evictions based on rent costs and unemployment rate.

10870,0,"Hello r/realestateinvesting,

Been a long time poster and this sub has been so tremendously helpful with making decisions for our real estate portfolio. I am currently in Texas, and have an active portfolio of 11 properties that I have been self-managing up until this past summer due to moving to a different state for a huge career move in the next month. Hence, I hired a property manager and have transitioned most of the properties to be professionally managed (AMA if you need help with this). 

However, all but one property has been rented. I am in a really hot market, bought the property in 2016 for $65k, put roughly $10k into the deal to fix it up and I have had it rented between $950-$1,100 for the last 3ish years. I am a licensed real estate agent and really strong comps put the deal at $119k, or a $60k-$70k profit (with principal reduction) if I sold this month.  Property is under my personal name (sole-proprietorship) and not an LLC. 

Here is my question and curious about what you all think. 

Because I am moving to a new state for a job, I am thinking about selling this property in Texas via a 1031 exchange, purchasing a duplex in the new state ($289k purchase price, 4,000 sq.ft significantly larger than current home), and house hacking for the first year while we build our ""dream home."" The goal would be to rent out the other side of the duplex and live rent-free while the ""dream home"" is being built and rent out the full-duplex once ""dream home"" is finished. I would use the 1031 exchange money as the downpayment for the duplex and would look to put it into a 30-year, fixed-rate, conventional loan with 20% down. 

Here are my questions - 

1. What do you think of this strategy? I.e. sell property in Tyler TX &gt; 1031 exchange into duplex &gt; live 1 year in duplex &gt; move into new home 
2. Is this even possible? I.e. using 1031 exchange dollars to purchase a duplex renting out one side + living in the other? 
3. I am a licensed realtor, but should I hire another realtor that specializes in 1031 exchanges or just find a good qualified intermediary and do it myself with their help to hold the money for the exchange, etc? 
4. Any headaches from a 1031 exchange or tips from your experience? 
5. Have you ever house hacked before with a wife and daughter? How did it go?
6. I have the cash and don't need the money from the 1031 exchange. Should I hold and lower the rental price to get it rented and not do a 1031 exchange? 

Would love to get your feedback and happy to answer any questions that you might have on what it was like going from self-managing to professional management.  Thank you for all of your help!

TL/DR - have a home that has appraised significantly in value and want to do a 1031 exchange from Texas to another state to buy a larger + more expensive duplex and live in one side and rent out the other. Is it possible and any suggestions? Any experience with a 1031 exchange? Investing strategy advice"

I have not had to deal with this exact situation but they also just told me that is the way it is, without citing a specific FHA regulation.

What would you be doing in the current housing climate? My personal experience is that everything with a decent price goes for way over list price and is gone off of the MLS in a couple of days. I don't want to buy over list price, because rarely do the numbers make sense after that point. **Where should a person in this situation be looking outside of the MLS? Where can you find off market deals that so you don't pay so much over list? Am I just being impatient and I should just keep waiting? Should I just keep renting for now?**

Very early into looking into this, but I'm thinking about building a multifamily home in Chicago. There's a plot of land I've been eyeing, but I want to know the process of building a house? I.e. what do I do first, second, third, etc. How can I get quotes before buying the land? Is there one company I can work with to give me a quote and do all the construction? 

Thanks in advance! How do you build a house in Chicago?"
10874,0,"Looking for some advice/suggestions. My long-term goal is to pick up rental properties as investments with my brother. 

New home: 4b 2.5ba 2100 sqft on 8000sqft lot
$600K purchase price, 20% down ($120K), loan for $480K, 2.750% for 30 years. Mortgage ~2600/mo including taxes/insurance.

Old home: 3b 1.5ba 1200 sqft on 7400 sqft lot
Mortgage balance remaining ~$220K with 3% interest. Monthly payment $1550. 

Market is ~20 minutes north of Seattle in a HOT suburb (Lynnwood, WA) where housing demand is booming with extremely low supply. Prices have been overinflated for a long time now, covid had essentially no negative effect on prices here. Houses go up and are sold within a week, pretty much always way over list price. 

New home def needs some renovations. We were thinking of selling our old home - pay off remaining mortgage balance obviously, pay ourselves back for the down payment, use some extra money for renovations - new floors/carpet, repaint inside to our liking, new counters, new appliances (non-cosmetic things - inspector says siding should be replaced most urgently, roof eventually as it's nearing 20 years but still looking decent overall, some minor plumbing and electrical issues). Could use some additional money towards student loans or hold onto it and use it to purchase a rental property in future. 

However, I was just throwing around the idea of renting out our old home (roof needs to be replaced ASAP, we haven't had any issues yet but there are definitely some leaks and minor mold in the attic) and just getting a HELOC on our new home with the $120K equity I have, and using that HELOC for renovations instead. 

The old home could potentially rent for $2500-2700/mo. We would net ~$1k monthly and use that to pay towards the HELOC/mortgage on the new home. If we were to sell it in this market, we've been told we could get 500k as is easily. I'm tempted to list it FSBO just to see what kind of offers we get. 

This would give us (myself for the new home and my mom for old home) both the tax benefits of home ownership and also an additional $1k/month in income. They're building a lightrail less than 5 minutes from my house (monorail public transportation) which will undoubtedly increase the value once it's done in a few years. This city has a heavy commuter population that relies on this specific transit center to get to work. The location is ideal, public transportation everywhere, major freeways and highways all within 5 min, plenty of shopping (mall is 7 min away), restaurants, Costco/grocery, parks etc all within 5 min. Lots of new development in the works too. 

Should we capitalize on the hot market and sell now, or rent it out and wait for what's pretty much guaranteed appreciation due to decreasing supply/increasing demand and lots of public development ?

Thanks! First time home buyer just closed on my first home! Should we sell or rent out our previous residence? Help a brotha out!"
11600,0,"When calculating cash flow from a potential rental (assuming no views on appreciation) the ""simple"" math is:

`rent * 12 - hoa * 12 - prop_tax * 12 - epsilon`

Where `epsilon` are variable costs like PM or maintenance. I *think* the knobs above generally move up together (certainly property taxes tend not to fall as much as they go up) but tenant leases are usually one year (maybe two) and tenant turnover implies a best case scenario of a 1 month vacancy plus 1 month rent for listing fees (unless you do everything yourself?) - meaning the multiplier on rent of `12` is impossible and the realistic multiplier from amortizing these is lower (11? 10?). As `rent` is the largest of the variables above, the multiplier on it is very significant on the net cash flow - what do y'all find is a more realistic multiplier? Or am I looking at this the wrong way? Do you guys amortize in periods of vacancy and listing fees for rentals?"

Even if I rationalize the fees (I would spend as much anyway if I owned a detached house or a townhouse), I fail to understand the end game here. If the condo fees are going to keep increasing, there will come a time when it is so high that selling it will become difficult. I can already see that the older condos which are bigger are prices way lower than the newer ones which are smaller. So what’s the end game here? Do condos make sense as an investment only for the first couple of years? Or is it that one waits till it goes under redevelopment in 10/15 years? Or is it that the condo is meant to be rented and not sold and left as a continuing investment?

Hello again Reddit,

First, I’m happy to say that I finally found some of the info I was looking for. My grandparents purchased their home in 1981 for $81,500.

So to say I understand a bit more about how the process works, I’d like to try and clarify my specific problem in a bit similar if terms. 

The will of my grandparents should of been written and completed years and years ago, however for whatever reason it wasn’t. Unfortunately... 

In a short phrase my grandpa’s health issue came quick and took his life much quicker than we all could have expected and my grandma’s health left no time and quickly followed right behind him with him. 

Her mental and physical health has taken her from us since (a little over a year since his passing now) and my grandmother has become a completely different person. Not too coherent, can’t have common conversations and speaks as she is living in her past. It is hard for all of us everyone to witness and has turned the family against each other.

The “Will” has now been completed legally by my grandma during this time of mental and physical hardship.

My grandma changed many things apprentices with her new mindset.

The biggest hit is to my mother who was suppose to inherit the house as she will not have one after my grandmas passing of the house is sold. She’s moved in with grandma and been the care taker since my grandpa got sick and has struggled personally separating from my dad all at the same time. 

During the writing of my grandparents will, it was brought to my mom and her sister’s attention that there was a reverse mortgage in the house. My mom nor her sisters could explain to me what that meant, all they had to tell me was that they will more than likely not only lose the house all together but also won’t be receiving a dime!!!
What?!?!

The me in me is NOT happy and my blood has found an all new boiling temperature.

My mom and my grandma are the two people in life I owe everything too. They give and give and everyone has always just took and took. It’s a classic tale and I won’t allow my aunt to write the ending. Sorry that was a bit poetic wasn’t it? lol

Yea, I’m seeking a solution mostly for my mother but also for the family home and even a partnership with the family but I know that wouldn’t be a consideration. 

Since I’ve found out the value of the house, how can I determine when they took out a reverse mortgage and for how much?

I need information so I can do my best to try and educate these my aunts, including my mother on why they should not just be throwing this away. 

PS: I do understand that it’s life and simply an unfortunate situation for certain people. I know it just comes down to the black and the white, it may seem to some that this is all unnecessary and selfish that I’m  trying to step in and research for myself but my gut tells me I must try!

Thank again everyone!


Hello Reddit!

I am looking for anyone who could explain in the simplest of terms how buying a property (single family home) with a reverse mortgage works. Reverse mortgage and home was purchased in the late 1980’s

My specific situation:

My grandpa passed away last year and my grandma isn’t doing so well at the moment. They have owned their house since the late 1980’s.

My mother and her sisters have recently found out that when my grandparents purchased the house, it was purchased with a reverse mortgage.

No one knows a darn thing about Real Estate in my family (I know a little bit of common knowledge) and I don’t want the home (or their inheritance) to be taken, or handled incorrectly.

I’m quite nervous about what will happen if I don’t try and step in. I grew up in this house and would hate to see it go.

I’ve been in a good spot recently to purchase a home and have already been thinking about investing. So, it is very possible that I’d like to purchase the home when my grandma passes.

I’ve tried googling over and over how reverse mortgages worked in the 80’s and how much my grandparents purchased the house for but can’t find anything that far back in real estate history

I would really appreciate any advice on what I should expect with their reverse mortgage situation and history, as well as the best way to handle this situation.

Thank you so much everyone!

As the title states, I am trying to evaluate the worth of a small mobile home park that does not charge lot fees, but instead rents each home as if it were an apartment. Most formulations I have seen suggest taking occupied lot values and multiplying by 70-80 to get to a quick and dirty valuation.  I have yet to see any formulas for the scenario that I am looking into.

Since the economics seem to act almost like apartments, I have applied those metrics to it. The specific questions that I have are:

1) Is there some other analysis that I should be doing to reverse engineer a fair price?

2) Is this sort of setup (outright leases instead of pad rentals) something that investors usually stay away from? I can see an argument that way because unlike a traditional apartment, the homes themselves obviously have much less value.  However,  the numbers here seem to make some sense (20% CoC return, etc).

I've knocked out [5 of the books at the top of this list](https://www.biggerpockets.com/forums/12/topics/661914-most-mentioned-books-of-all-312-bp-podcasts) and have interviewed a handful of colleagues with adjacent experience. However, much of the information I'm finding is geared towards the beginning investor who has limited starting finances/time/education.

I don't fear the trap of not getting started. I do fear the trap of not moving with the appropriate haste/safety mix for my level of available inputs. I am very well funded for my outset, I'm able to commit tremendous amounts of time to my efforts, and I'm not a complete mental reject.

Leaning on the depth of YOUR experience, **KWYKN**, how would you use these advantages to rationally build a ten year plan for the kind of growth I outline in my title?

Thanks!

Unemployment rate for AZ is about 10%, Gilbert/ chandler being about 4%. Eviction ban has been extended. New neighborhoods are being built almost on every other block. Might be over exaggerating, but if I am it's just a little bit. Some other states look much worse. And I hear a lot of people from Cali are moving out to AZ. Isn't AZ's real estate supposed to be one of the strongest in the country atm? I am rather new to this still. But these are the numbers I have gathered.

Any advice? I plan on buying a 3-4 bedroom house and house hacking it, renting the rooms out to co workers/ friends or anyone really while living there myself. I talked to a real estate agent and of course he says it's time to buy due to low mortgage rates. But honestly imo these rates mean nothing to me, the prices of these homes especially in gilbert/chandler are just outrageous.  I mean 2 years back I could had bought some of these homes for 30-50k less. Please, this is just ridiculous. Even if I have my pre-approved VA loan. No way! San tan/ Queen Creek are about 30-50k less in price but its a good 30-45 minutes away from work. And if I plan on renting these rooms out well, there are more jobs in Gilbert/ Chandler of course. 

Anyone here experienced in real estate and in the markets that can help me decide on whether to stay on the side lines or not? I'm soo tired of renting, but I also don't want to miss out on a great opportunity. I have been waiting for soo long now. Arizona, buy now or stay on the sidelines?"

I realize prices for duplexes are all over the place and market/state rules may be different. 

For comparison reasons, my situation looks like this. Duplex value is $235-250k, this is my only property. I haven't had an appraisal recently but I am in a low cost of living area that is rapidly growing and home availability doesn't match growth which is driving prices up. I am seeing insurance premiums from $1900-4000 for all different coverage amounts in each category. I am surprised at how high the quote amounts from name brand insurers (All State, Farmers, State Farm, etc.) are. I am also receiving quotes from independent agents and premium prices are better but again the differences in coverage amounts per category makes it hard to compare.

Here is a range of prices per categories I am seeing at the moment:

|Dwelling|$315-336k|
|:-|:-|
|Other Structures|$16-33k|
|Personal Property|$67-220K|

13179,0,"I had a few contractors give me an estimate on my properties to finish a rehab. Picking up a partially rehabbed property as a newbie was bad idea in itself but that's beyond the point. 

The contractor did his thing, checked everything out and gave me quote of $50,000 labor only and said he was running a special so he'd knock it down to $30,600. Ok cool, win!

I told him I'd like move forward and asked him some initial questions. He wanted a 50% deposit upfront to start the work which I was uncomfortable with so I asked him if we could reduce the scope of work to trial out the relationship and his work. He comes back a couple days and offers to do the job with no deposit until 50% of the original scope is complete. Once 50% is complete, then I'd owe 75% of funds, roughly $20,000. This caught me off-guard as I wasn't expecting that all. 

Anyways, told him to send over his contract and I'll review it and make any edits to it. I get his contact and it's just some boiler plate language which standard and what I expected so I added in some of my clauses that I use and send back to him with questions about references, timeline of work, what order the work will be completed (this has not become a standard question for me to all contractors to weed out the bad ones), proof of insurance/license, etc.

Later that night I hop on call with him and he's asking what qualms I have about moving and getting started especially since he said he'd finance the labor out of pocket (I'm responsible for materials). I explained that we still needed to align timelines, order of work and what 50% completed work means. He said he understands and makes sense to align on the 50% but then he went on to say stuff to that he has $1-1.5M year revenue and this is actually a small job for him but he extended the olive branch because he really wanted to work with me and the area that property is in. When I asked for references then he'd want references from me so he can ensure I'm a legit and will pay. Ok? Told him I can provide references if he needed that. Seemed like he was offended with by my asks especially after he offered to do 50% of the work upfront for free. Ultimately, we ended at me indicating what 50% of completed work means and he'll review. He said it tough to give timeframe of work because there's work that needs to be redone and he won't know if things pop-up, etc. Makes sense to me and conversation ends because his phone dies.

We're supposed to meet at the property tomorrow but I wanted to see if anyone has had a situation like this? A contractor indicating to do 50% of the work without a deposit. Is this a red flag? Worth trying him out? Do I need to consider something else? Am I missing something?

Hello. I’ve never posted here before but hoping you all can help point me in the right direction. I’m using my throwaway cause people know me on my main account and i don’t like discussing finances publicly. 

I want to dive into real estate investing and I have a plan but am not sure how to go about executing it and I don’t know anyone I can ask. I’m not necessarily new to it, but haven’t really like taken the full plunge and I don’t know how to move forward. 

I’m 31 and married, my husband has a handyman business that’s a sole proprietorship. We are in the SE US and own three houses with no mortgages. I bought the first one when i was 21 and we’ve bought and paid off the others since. Between the three houses we have around  $600,000 in equity. We live in one, one is a triplex and is rented to long term tenants, the other is single family home that we are still rehabbing but will be done soon. The one house currently nets $24,000 per year and the second house will add an additional $15,000. 

We really enjoy being landlords and it’s been a great experience for us. Weve been doing it 8 years. Over the next few years, I’d like to get 4-5 more properties to either rent or flip. for around 60-75k each. The thing is, while we have no debt, we also have reported hardly any income over the last two years. Just the 24k from the rental and another $12k in schedule c. I had some medical issues and had to quit my job and needed to be in a lower income bracket to afford ACA insurance. I’m better now and have income again. 

So i know obviously this year and going forward we will need to be reporting more income so that we can qualify for loans again so I don’t plan on moving on this until at least 2022 or so. But I am wondering the best way to go about all of this to plan. 

Right now, the houses are just in our names, would we be better off forming a corporation and earning money through that and then apply for credit as a corporation? How does that work? Is it possible to get an equity loan that way or would it be a different kind of loan?

 How much profit would a corporation need to be reporting and how long does it need to exist to get a large loan like that? I have no idea how any of that works or what kind of person I talk to to figure that out. 

Eventually I’d like to get a construction loan to build on a lot we have as well. But that’s probably later down the road after buying a few more houses. 

So that’s my main question. How do i get from where I’m at now to getting enough credit to be able to buy more properties?

Thank you! How to get credit from equity to buy more investment properties. Please help i am totally clueless on the loan stuff."

13185,0,"I'm fairly new to real estate investing, Live in Los Angeles, and looking at doing a cash out refinance and using the cash to buy an investment property. It seems too good to be true so I'm wondering if I'm missing something and wondering if anyone is doing something similar right now due to the current market and low rates.

**Current Mortgage**

* Home Value: $600k
* Current Loan Value: $440k
* Current Mortgage Rate: 3.875%
* Monthly payment incl taxes: $2,700

**Cash out Refinance Proposal:**

* Home Value: $600k
* Loan Value: $480k
* Cash Out: $40k
* Mortgage Rate: 2.99%
* Monthly Payment incl taxes: $2,700
* $1,500 closing costs

Basically I can refinance and pull $40k out in cash, keep the same monthly payment, and only pay 1,500 in closing costs. I'd use the $40k and additional savings as a down payment for an additional property that I'd rent out. This seems too good to be true. Am I missing anything here? Anyone doing the same thing right now?

The other option is to do a regular refinance (no cash out) and save $200 per month. Also attractive, but getting $40k cash right now that I can put to work seems like it has much more upside, particularly if the real estate market dips due to COVID-19 foreclosures in the near future. The $40k in cash would really come in handy to swoop up a deal.

Here in LA the rent to purchase price ratio is pretty low, so the main purpose of buying another property would for the appreciation rather than rental income (although rental income can be a benefit down the line). Cash out refinance during low mortgage rates and hot real estate market ?"
13187,0,"My Grandfather left my family a small fortune in real estate which includes a 45 unit apartment complex, two rental houses, and 7 small commercial rental properties. In my opinion this portfolio has afforded my family a lot but I feel like I’m the only one that realizes this. My mom and uncle are the ones who currently run the company and are in their 60’s. My uncle is tired of dealing with apartment renters and wants to sell. He thinks the money would be better invested in the stock market. I have told them multiple times that I would take over some of the responsibilities but in order to do so they would have to pay me a little each month. I think because of cash flow management they don’t realize the amount of money that we make and the potential we have to capitalize off of what we have and that we should expand our real estate holdings. Am I wrong? I think we could build this company into something that my generation could also benefit from for years to come and I’m extremely frustrated by the idea of them wanting to sell. The apartments are old and a lot of money goes into them but if the money was handled correctly I think it could net around $25k each month after expenses.

I recently listened to BP with a guest who went so far as to have a cleaning service and provide toiletries, etc. In my opinion he sounded like he was just gloating / taking a victory lap the whole episode, but it got me thinking. 

What solutions have you provided to get ahead of potential areas of contention? Some ideas I've been toying with..

- furnished room

- mini fridge in room

- providing some consumables (dish soap for example)

- hired cleaning service at some interval.

Obviously some of these could be abused, but perhaps the risk of that is better than the risk of tension between house mates. 

I see a gap in the market from about $850/mo for a room in my area (nicer than my house) and about $1200/mo for a studio. There's very little if anything for rent in that price gap. I wonder if providing more value than the typical room rental (and raising price accordingly) would allow me to be in a less competitive environment, or if maybe I would just be pricing myself too high and no one would actually want to pay for those things since a studio is just a few hundred more.

I live with my girlfriend who bought her single family house on her own before I met her. Before her, I had saved a bunch of money to buy a house, but she has no intention on adding me to the mortgage. I’ve never owned a home but have always wanted to get into real estate. We are not too far from a resort town and we like to spend a lot of time there, so I figured it would make sense to buy a vacation home and keep it in my name since the primary residence is in her name.

Renting wouldn’t be a problem, and I’m only looking to break even with the rental income vs any mortgage loan.

13195,0,"Since I've never posted in too much depth here before, here's a quick background on me. Prior to 2016, I was being trained as the successor to my dad in the family real estate business (notes, land, and SFH). My parents split in 2016, my mom got the business, and my succession timeline got moved up in a way that I never really saw coming. I've been learning as I go, and I've done a lot of work to pare down and revamp the portfolio we had on the table as well as locking in some of our existing gains. Currently, our properties are averaging a 11-cap compared to a 5-7-cap on the same properties in 2016 as a result of value-adding decisions and market growth in our area. Not too bad for someone working on their undergrad and masters, pulling the trigger on strategic decisions, and most definitely a credit to the business school I attend as well as you guys (I've learned a lot from folks like GG and /u/german_mafia on here). 

As of today, we've charted our exit from the notes business and are in the process of preparing to foreclose on the last note in our portfolio (and the only one that I underwrote). All of our other exits were sales of performing notes at yields relatively close to par (w/in a percent), and I'm definitely okay with that since having deployable cash in the current environment was a major strategic goal that I had when we started back up in 2017.

With regard to this foreclosure (the only one we've had to do, ever, pre-or-post-2016), this has been one of, if not the single, hardest decision that I've ever had to make. I've spent several nights in the last month up deep into the night agonizing over this decision, and I felt like no matter what choice I was going to make, I was going to hurt the borrowers and their family on the other side of this deal. I've done evictions in the past of the non-performing tenants we got hung with in 2017 and early 2018, but this doesn't feel the same way. It's not even remotely close. 

I don't know if it's just that I lack the nerve to be in this line of the business or if I'm giving these folks the benefit of too much of my empathy, but I'm staying out of it from here on out unless it's making HMLs to investors only. I don't have the stomach to do what's necessary with an O/O and don't think I ever will, simply due to the second-order effects that my decisions can have.

I want to thank you guys, though, for being a large wealth of knowledge and hope that I can still glean some knowledge from y'all as we start to scale from SFH to MFH and commercial in the coming years, and that I can provide some insight of value to y'all as well.

If a good return on your rental property investment is about 10% (this is just what I've read a few places online) and the building appreciates at roughly 4% per year, your investment has made you about 14% per year.   


If you invest that same money into safe stocks/ETFs with 3-4% Div/yield and the market increase by around 10% each year you're essentially making the same amount of money with a lot less work and greater diversification in your investment.    


So what am I missing? Is the normal return on rental properties actually higher than that 10%, or is it something else?  


Thank you for any insights or feedback! Why invest in rental properties instead of the stock market?"

I have one rental and it’s leased and they are great tenants who continue to pay. I have an opportunity to buy again and I’m afraid due to the the pandemic that our current home would take longer to rent leaving us with two mortgages for a while.

14002,0,"Hey folks,

Oakland, California

I'm exploring getting into real estate investing and recently I took a look through my girlfriend's townhome ownership documents to work on familiarizing myself with how they might differ from a SFH scenario.

I'm particularly curious about the maintenance agreement that is in place. In the ""**Declaration of Easements; Agreement for Maintenance and Reimbursement; and Covenants Running With The Land**"", there are a variety of stipulations that appear to outline how the owners of the 10 units in this development will handle maintenance of common areas.

\- Each owner or owners get one 'vote' per unit

\- Maintenance required in common areas can be achieved by majority vote owners, a designee, and 1/10 reimbursement requirements

\- An owners failure to pay can be addressed with interest outlined in the agreement and property is vulnerable to liens

\- One clause outlines the obligation of a noncomplying to owner to reimburse enforcement court fees as necessary.

While it's clear that this is a strategy to avoid having an HOA, I'm very curious about the utility/wisdom/enforceability of these provisions. The 10 units are currently an assortment of owner occupied, rented, and AirBnB. From what I've observed and have confirmed with my girlfriend, the current climate is cordial but nonfunctional. There is, and hasn't been for 2-3 years, no one filling in the point-person role and no ongoing mutual activities towards maintenance. I've seen at least one passive aggressive email complaining about an unrequited fees request for work the owner performed with no discussion beforehand. He's since departed and it seems 1-2 units turn over per year.

Questions:

\- Is it safe to assume that all owners will remain encumbered with these clauses in their titles in perpetuity? Certainly, my GF purchased the unit she owns from an owner who bought when construction was new, so I know it's supposed to continue to attach.

\- From an owners perspective these clauses appear to be way more headache than the average owner would care to pursue/or appreciate being pursued for, up until non-maintenance was obstructive or harmful. Enforcement seems like a lot of thankless work while alienating neighbors who are close AF. Is there a silver lining I'm missing?

\- Is it correct to assume that these clauses are also terrible from a rental property/landlord perspective? We will probably rent the place when we move together to a SFH (given sunk cost), but I can't imagine buying into a place like this for investing, right?

\- From a legal standpoint, how valuable are these clauses in a 'brass tacks' scenario? If an owner or landlord cared to make the time and stress investment to pursue proper maintenance and protection of home value, would the courts reliably support claims stemming from these clauses?

Thanks y'all!

14003,0,"So to keep this relatively concise, as the title mentions I intend to purchase 4 sf units from an old gentleman who is willing to owner finance them. 4 units for 100k. He is willing to accept just 9k down at 6% interest over 18 years. (He told me explicitly that he doesn't care how long because he'll be dead lol) I chose 18 years because at that rate that should put monthly payments at just under 700 with the current net rent at 2075/month.  2 of these units are drastically under market because of the area and the long term tenants that he has had no desire to see evicted.  I think i can get an additional 4 to 600 rent out of these in the near future.  
My primary questions are should i build in an optional balloon payment maybe 5-10 yrs in that i can refinance through another institution?
And the 9k i am putting down is coming from my SO with whom I live and recently bought our house with. She had some equity from selling her prior residence. Is there a way that I can draft a loan agreement to pay her back over a longer period of time at a high interest rate that might be tax advantageous to us both? Agreed to terms to owner finance 4 sf homes"
14004,0,"We are closing on a 17 plex in a HCOL which we will be stripping completely. All 1965 original stuff!

Given the size, we have been considering ordering a container from China. Everything price wise isn't a big win excel for 
-Tile
-Kitchen, bathroom and shower plumbing and faucets
-Portable AC units that are CE rated for canadian laws (units a 350 square feet)

Has anyone else looked into this and was it worth it? On those items we are saying around 300-350 per unit for plumbing EASY so thats 4K (including shipping and duties cost)
Tile should save us another 1-2$ a square foot so around 3-6k there. 
A/c units around 150$ each so another 2K there. Sourcing materials from China for larger Multi Family. Anyone done it?"

14007,0,"So here’s the situation my wife and I find ourselves in. 

Her grand parents passed away leaving property to her and her brother. Her mother passed away, but prior to that, had signed the property to my wife’s brother. My wife signed her half of her grandparents property to her brother in exchange for her mother’s property. No money changes hands, just his for hers and now each sibling has a piece of property. 

We are selling her mothers property now, how should we handle the taxes?  Are we subject to capital gains tax due to the property technically being given to us by her brother?  Is there a way it can be shown as an inheritance by us to avoid capital gains tax? 

At closing we were given a 1099-S for the price of the sale. 

Thanks for any light you can shed on the subject. Second property sale tax questions."
14010,0,"I found a turnkey rental that would be about $40k for down payment and closing costs and what not. My yearly proceeds would be $2k after management fees and everything else. They have a 33% occupancy rate that, it's a touristy area but I can't change that because I'm not allowed to circumvent the management company by listing it. I can't install any features that would make it more appealing without board approval and it sounds strict.




Is this a no go, or are there any creative ideas to make it more profitable? With a low occupancy rate I could use it but that doesn't make me money. Is 5% return on a vacation rental even worth it?"
14011,0,"Hi all. New to the thread and appreciate the collective wisdom of the group.

With the oft discussed BRRRR strategy for real estate investing (buy, rehab, rent, refi, repeat), I was hoping someone could weigh in on the refinance portion if you purchase the initial property with cash. E.g., paying all cash upfront to be more competitive in the bid process and then pulling out a substantial amount of capital once renovated and rented.

Specifically, will conventional lenders underwrite loans to a homeowner if just pulling out 75% of the newly appraised property value? Not familiar with taking out a home loan on a property you already own in full. If not a conventional lender, is there other viable alternatives to recouping much of your capital without a sale/ private money’s higher interest rates? Refi on cash purchase specifics"
14012,0,"First time landlord here, and where my unit I purchased has largely been profitable, I know there's some areas of concern I need to keep an eye on. One big thing is that the roof is coming up on it's life expectancy, and as it's on the 3rd layer I'll need to replace the roof. Another is the back porch/deck; when I was purchasing the house the deck came into question a lot, with city inspectors and local contractors giving contrasting opinions. Recently I got a structural engineer I could trust to take a look, and he recommends having the deck replaced, but it'll still hold for at least a couple years.

So my question is, how do I best approach these expenses? Should I try to knock them out sooner than later to avoid damages and liabilities? Do I wait a few years to get what life I can out of them? And are there ways I can approach them so that it's advantageous to me, perhaps in tax savings?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance!  


Update: Sounds like thus far I'm getting similar opinions, which is definitely great! I too would like to defer on the roof, which thankfully is not leaking. However, just to me it seems like waiting for a leak to occur then puts me in a bind where I need a new roof ASAP. Are there telltale signs that would let me know the time has come?  
As for the deck, I should've mentioned that it's access from the upstairs to the yard, and the only access unless you go around through the front yard by the side of the house. I'm not sure I could remove it and leave it. Once it comes down something needs to go up, be it a new deck or a staircase. Sorry I left out that detail. When should I make major repairs"

Hopefully posting this in the right place. 

I just purchased my first property in March. Just finished the remodel and have tenants moving in next week. 

A few people have told me to put this into an LLC for tax reasons as well as liability reasons. Is this really the way to go? Or since I only have one property it doesn’t make much of a difference but if I buy another then I should? Income property placed into LLC?"
14016,0,"Hi All, I'm a first time home buyer and newbie investor.  

I've been looking for a Multi-Family to owner-occupy, and I don't have much money for renovations, so I'm looking for something mostly turnkey.  However, I haven't been able to find much in my area in my price range (less than $400K).  In 7 months I've written one offer and lost by $5K...

That said, I'm thinking about switching it up in a couple months if this keeps up.  If so, what would be your recommendations?  I was thinking SFH in the $100-$250K range in a good school district in the burbs?  It seems like SFH's in that price range offer better cash flow compared to the $300K+ in the city.

Just want take action... Frustrated with Lack of Multi-Families. Should I change my criteria?"

I’ve been checking prices and market trends in the area online (Redfin) and running my valuations. Would the next step be to talk with local lenders in that area to get pre-qualified... and then what? Reach out to realtors?

Edit: for context, the place I want to do the deal in is an area I previously lived in for 10 years (and was staying at before the pandemic), and would plan to move back to if/when I could find a suitable property to house hack.
