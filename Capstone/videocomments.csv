They made changes to putting the back on, so the problems you experienced I didn't have.   Yes, it's shockingly FIRM almost to the point of being disappointing.  BUT, I sat all day for several days with no discomfort. Soooooo, maybe it's perfect?  Most people I know wouldn't spend $460 (US) for a chair, and if they did, would expect a cloud experience.  On a scale of 1 to 10 for satisfaction, I'm an 8.  Why?  I'd like it more if when I sat down it didn't feel like I was sitting on a stone park bench.   Yea, I forget about it as I sit, but still....

31glAeRYkD4,"I bought a Global Obuform chair about 15 years ago that I paid then $765.00 CDN which is about $400 pound then. It was worth that much and more for what it did to my herniated back. I bought another model of their orthopaedic Office Chair and paid a little over $600 CDN 3 years ago and it is already falling apart so I bought a SecretLab Titan XL because the mechanism is extra strong. I will receive it mid August 2020 and I am expecting as much as the Obuform was with the added adjustable lumbar support. When you have a bad back,  a good orthopaedic chair is what you need to buy even if you think it is too expensive, try it on and advise.

I experienced the same shock when I bought this type of armchair and it turned out to be damn hard. I bought the Quersus GEOS 701 armchair for 359 pounds, has the same functions and sits just as hard. At this price, I hoped it would sit like on cloud. From the perspective of 4 years, I think that gaming chairs are not intended for slim and tall people. If you have backache, you need to look for ergonomic chairs, something like WAU 2.

By using their customers for marketing rather than spending tens or hundreds of thousands on a marketing campaign they can offer their product at a more competitive price.

The only one not worth the money is the Hermann Miller. The neck, lumbar and head support is much better when you sit in a top line 2020 gaming chair, like a Titan or Maxnomic OC. Many of the ergonomic task chairs even don‚Äòt have ANY lumbar or head support, they are only 2/3 size. The High Versions costs 300-500$ more and then when we are talking about _at least_ 1200bucks.

31glAeRYkD4,"Great review - thank you! I reckon the firmness is part of why your back doesn't hurt anymore; kind of like a firm mattress being better for your back than a really soft one. Of course one doesn't want it too firm. That lad complaining about it going right up his arse had me in stitches! But really, it sounds like it does what it's supposed to.  

This chair is available in Oz for around 600 AUD which at current exchange rates is only 310 quid so either the price has come down since your review or you're getting ripped off in the UK (or we're getting a great deal in Oz- especially given how the AUD is pretty low ATM.) FWIW, I know that name brand ergonomic office chairs can easily be around 1,000 AUD so I'd view this as an upper mid-priced chair. Anyway, I've subscribed and will be interested to see any updates you care to make. The fact that you tested it for 8 weeks makes this review A LOT more useful than 99% of the other reviews out there!

31glAeRYkD4,"Hi Stu,  
I just received my Titan L today - with the PU leather option, rather than soft weave.  I moved up from a 17 year old knackered (nearly) office chair I inherited from my father - which was soft, leather affair with hardly any lumbar support and certainly fewer adjustable parts.

For context, I am used to using a ¬£700 Herman Miller Mirra 2 Triflex Chair at work, which are very comfy for long sits, but significantly more expensive  than most gaming chairs.

I was looking around for a decent chair while I am forced to work from home during the lock down, having developed a sore back sitting in my old 17 year old chair (which my kids now use!) and this had great reviews, including by those who use the same office chair as me, and compared it favourably.

I can't say I'm disappointed ! It might be expensive in comparison to a typical Staples or Ikea chair, but is of a much better build quality and I'll bet it'll last a lot longer too!

I'm happy with the comfort level, - it's worth noting that if  a chair is too soft it wont provide firm support. But that is an individual thing.

I love the adjust-ability of it, and found it a cinch to put together. Bit concerned about the dire warnings about fingers being trapped all over the box!

Already I can feel a huge difference to my back with the lumbar support, and it doesn't hurt that it can recline so well!

31glAeRYkD4,"Finally a honest review, there are so many fake reviews about Secretlab chairs. I wanted to buy the Titan so I asked my colleague if I could borrow his Secretlab Titan for a few days, he was okay with that. To be honest I was really dissapointed with the Secretlab Titan, it looks great but it's NOT COMFORTABLE AT ALL!! It feels like sitting on a wooden chair. I recommend everyone considering buying a Secretlab to try it first to avoid dissapointment, this chair is not for everyone.

31glAeRYkD4,Thank you for posting an honest review. I bought the Omega and am really having a hard time trying to tell myself that I like it...but I am in more pain now than I was before buying it.  Honestly makes me not want to use my computer anymore,0,Sgt Nooodle,2020-04-04 06:08:54+00:00,"@Saahir RahamanThe seat itself was probably the easiest part to adjust to. I was surprised at how close it required me to keep my legs if I didn't want the pressure from the sides of the seat, but I hardly notice that now. The biggest issue is with the arm rest positioning, arm rest angle, and the shoulder positioning of the backrest. First off, the armrests on this chair are very hard. I see sponsored reviews where people try to claim they are soft and comfortable... They're not. I am 31 years old, so I am just starting to notice when things hurt, and these arm rests hurt. They are positioned far back on the chair, and even with the 4D movement and spacial adjustments you can make under the chair, they still seem very far back on the chair. The biggest issue I have with them is the angle they are at when the chair is locked at an upright sitting position. No matter how I adjust them, I am having either constant pain in my forearm or constant pain in my shoulder, elbow, and hand. These are clear signs of carpal tunnel syndrome, as well as issues with the radial and ulnar nerves, all of which I had no clear issues with until I bought this chair. To give you an idea of size, I am 5'8"" and about 170lbs, which falls within the range of the Omega chair... However I find that I feel too big for the chair.",Sgt Nooodle,0,2020-04-08 07:28:13+00:00

31glAeRYkD4,"The genius of this chair is that it goes against what you think comfort is. I've been plagued by back problems my entire life, compounded by a spinal injury several years ago. Any length of time spent at my desk would result in both back pain and what I call ""chair fatigue"". 

After a month of using it I had NO back pain. None. Not a bit and chair fatigue was non existant. I can sit in that thing for 12 hours plus and I just don't get tired. And this is no fan boying. I've owned so many chairs that I've lost count and they all failed me in some way. But this chair just keeps on giving. 

I love it and my wife loves it. Not only is a delight for her to sit in after a long shift caring for sick and elderly patients but it's genuinely made her a happier person. And I have to admit it made me a happier, more relaxed and less irratible person as well. 

This chair may not give you what you 'think' you want, but it certainly gives you what you need. Gone are the days paying for back treatments, painkillers and any sort of cushion to make a cheaper chair feel comfortable enough to use for prolonged periods. 

Also they are built like tanks. After several months of use the chair looks and feels as good as the day I got it. 

I set up a computer in another room and bought myself a cheaper chair that looked similar. And that was all that was similar. Within days my back was complaining, the arm rests just weren't right and I was napping during the day just to take a rest from sitting. So today I put together a new one and I don't regret a penny I've spent on either of the Titans we now own. Yes it is expensive, but how much am I going to save on back pain treatments? How much sanity will I save now I'm relaxed and my relationship has improved. I know it's crazy to say and probably more crazy to read, but it's the truth. 

Now as to cost. I think of it this way. How long do we spend in bed each day? Now think how much you would spend on your bed.

Ignoring the initial impression about the firmness of the chair (in my experience most proper office chairs are firm, with minimal padding), would you say it's comfortable?  When I say comfortable, after sitting down for 3 hours, are there any noticeable pain points, is your bottom numb or is there pressure on your coccyx? I'm not expecting an arm chair...

However, if I sit in it for longer than an hour, my tailbone hurts immensely when I go to stand up. I know the chair is harder/firmer than most chairs but this seems a little more extreme than that. There seems to be some sort of metal support underneath the cushion at that spot where you would sit your tailbone too so I don't know if that plays into it as well.

If I sit for a long time, I tend to adjust where I'm sitting or it becomes a bit uncomfortable.    I'm thinking maybe getting one of those thin high quality flat foam pads to make it just a slight be softer so I don't become uncomfortable after a while.  Other than that, I've owned many of those cheap $150-180 chairs you get from Staples and similar stores.  This chair is way better quality and much more comfortable.

31glAeRYkD4,"This is a solid enough review but it certainly does show the damage that cheap office/gaming chair makers have done to the overall market. Most folks who go out to buy some kind of desk/office/gaming chair to use at their computer will not do a ton of research and will only really see the rather cheap and poorly built options in the $100 to $250 range. This has created a misunderstanding since many potential chair shoppers are going to see that price range as ""normal"" without considering the compromises made to build quality to reach that price point. Those that do dig into it a bit and do some research will find that there are a metric ton of really cheap, generally disposable chairs and a handful of companies making really expensive, really high-end chairs. These high-end chairs end up running into the $1000+ range pretty easily and are simply not practical for a lot of consumers. Sadly, this chair sits in a unpleasant position since it is generally really well built and is priced rather reasonably (relatively speaking) but it also isn't going to show up at a place like Staples, Best Buy, or even Ikea. People who are looking for that ""best bang for the buck"" option are going to have a hard time finding out that this thing exists and that is a shame.",0,Michael Holmes,2020-01-17 00:30:06+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

31glAeRYkD4,"I recieved my Secretlabs Omega Chair two days ago. After sitting on cheap chairs all my life and burning through average office chairs who go for about 80-150 euros, the Omega really holds up in terms of quality. I too imaged it would be softer, but in the end its the firmness and stability that gets you through the day sitting. In my day to day job i also sit most of the time, so my work chair isnt super comfy, but not unpleasent either - but my ass won't hurt when i sit on there for at least 8 hours 5 days a week. And thats the same feeling and support i get from the Omega. It's build like a tank and to last, which was also a consideration on my part - because i dont like to buy shit every goddamn two years.

I always advice people to fork out ¬£850 on a new Steelcase/Herman Miller chair. It will last for a decade and the warranty will cover almost anything. This thing will be torn to bits within 3 years, guaranteed.

The chair tilt doesn't seem good for rocking, because rocking forward causes a hard abrupt stop and it doesn't bounce back.  I wish the pillow had more give, and the armrests don't go back far enough.

Edit: after two weeks, I can say that the seat is a lot more comfortable than it was initially.  It's still pretty firm, though.

The pillow has a rubberised strip that grips, sadly there is NO material support behind that strip and it can easily tear, if it is ""rucked up"" or pulled against.
it should have had a backing material under that  strip OR glued it.
They clearly have ZERO intuitive or analytical ability... to not understand that a ""grip strip"" MUST be fully supported along the ENTIRE area, instead of stitching two rows into a shite unsupported material.. give it a try.. you can EASILY pick holes in he material, rub it with your thumb and it  breaks along the stitching line




Yes there Is something wrong with the chair stiffness, not only that the chair slopes backwards and has a raised lip at the front
this sits DIRECTLY UNDER your main leg arteries... and cuts off the blood supply, after a while your legs go cold or you feel them throbbing...
Sit in the chair in an upright position and after a while you cannot piss fully.... emptying the last liquid out of your bladder is painful... which means there is pressure on your prostate.
stop sitting in it a couple of days or switch the chair out and back to normal....",0,Blind Bob,2020-01-07 23:15:34+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

I've never once thought it's too firm actually. I was worried that it would be hard seeing several people complaining about that. I guess it would be nice if they had a softer edition for those who really wish to have a softer seat (like matrasses for beds coming in several firmness) but I think they just went with a firmness that should be good for your body and went with just one. So yeah, I'm certainly keeping the chair, and I'm happy with it.

I do have the chair as well, and I completely agree with me expecting it to be much softer than it is BUT.. i had a high quality soft chair before and after just couple of years all those soft parts were sat through and hard as a rock.

But finally an honest review out there (and the reason I know it's honest is because I personally own this chair) and everything you mention is definitely true. The chair is stiff not super comfortable. Yes very good for the back though with the lumbar support. But after sitting in this chair for several hours I definitely have to get up and walk around for a bit also the arm rests are pretty bad and while you can adjust them they aren't padded at all. Overall it's not a bad chair but it's definitely not worth the $400 price tag.,1,Dankwalker,2019-12-16 07:44:19+00:00,"I find it extremely comfortable.

31glAeRYkD4,"I bought the Titan around two weeks ago and not saying this because I paid $394 US for the chair I'm going to say it because it has helped me a lot already. I'm disabled with a very bad back, I sit at my computer pretty much 8 to 10 hrs a day. The Titan is the most comfortable chair I've found to date and I've spent a little over $2000 US over the last 3 years or so trying to find something that didn't make me want to scream. The Titan is very firm to sit in but it does conform to you while at the same time supporting all the right parts. It's also large enough for someone like myself who's right at 6 foot and 276 pounds, Ya I know I'm an old fat man but that's okay. As far as quality if you've bought so called office chairs or gaming chairs in the quantity that I have you would be impressed by it. Watching you try to build yours was actual torture, why in the hell did you try that balancing act to get the back on instead of sitting the chair base flat on the box it shipped in to have it up a little bit and then quite easily slide the back into position? I guess my knowing to do that comes from the sheer number of these style of chairs I've built over the years. I didn't notice the relief cuts on the bottom of mine as you did on yours but I'm sure they're probably there as it's common practice in automotive seats to cut that type of relief so the fabric doesn't stretch and tear in the corners. The Hog Rings as they are called are widely used in Upholstery and quite common, if used correctly like on the Titan you'll notice that inside that fabric loop they're going into there is a metal rod that the fabric has been folded over and then double stitched into place. That type of anchoring system will literally last for decades or until the fabric has completely broken down. Look under the seat in your car or truck when you get a chance and I'm betting they are used there as well. These chairs are designed after Automotive Seats and made much in the same way. The Cold Molded Foam of the seat base is also something that's used in high quality auto seats as it lasts for years and never becomes squishy as other less dense cheaper foam does. I'm looking forward to using mine for years and not having to continually be in more pain than needed or having to spend more money to buy lesser quality chairs. I was tired of buying chairs for $100 to $200 US only to have them be uncomfortable or simply break down and fall apart, so I figured why the hell not just spend the money and get something that would last.
   Anyway this is all subjective but I spent around a year researching, watching reviews and reading them. I found that they're overwhelmingly positive as in stupidly so, this chair and Secret Labs as a whole has between a 98 to 99% positive review rating which is unheard of for a product of this type. Not even the top dogs can make that claim. I hope you continue to enjoy yours as I will mine and thank you for an honest open video of your opinions and feelings about the chair. The fact you've found it helps you has re-enforced what I've found/felt and it isn't just in my head because I spent so damned much money, LOL...

The Hog Rings as they are called are widely used in Upholstery and quite common, if used correctly like on the Titan you'll notice that inside that fabric loop they're going into there is a metal rod that the fabric has been folded over and then double stitched into place. That type of anchoring system will literally last for decades or until the fabric has completely broken down. Look under the seat in your car or truck when you get a chance and I'm betting they are used there as well. These chairs are designed after Automotive Seats and made much in the same way. The Cold Molded Foam of the seat base is also something that's used in high quality auto seats as it lasts for years and never becomes squishy as other less dense cheaper foam does. I'm looking forward to using mine for years and not having to continually be in more pain than needed or having to spend more money to buy lesser quality chairs. I was tired of buying chairs for $100 to $200 US only to have them be uncomfortable or simply break down and fall apart, so I figured why the hell not just spend the money and get something that would last.
   Anyway this is all subjective but I spent around a year researching, watching reviews and reading them. I found that they're overwhelmingly positive as in stupidly so, this chair and Secret Labs as a whole has between a 98 to 99% positive review rating which is unheard of for a product of this type. Not even the top dogs can make that claim. I hope you continue to enjoy yours as I will mine and thank you for an honest open video of your opinions and feelings about the chair. The fact you've found it helps you has re-enforced what I've found/felt and it isn't just in my head because I spent so damned much money, LOL...

and for years i never knew the name of the chairs this office has in mass. And after watching it was the aforementioned ""herman & miller"" or how ever you spell it. lol
and i have to say yeah it is really comfortable. you never really get ass fatigue or back fatigue. One thing i will say is the recline adjustment knob thing is ass. 
it gives you literal rug burn on your palm because you have to turn a knob forward and backward. 
after saying all that, yeah 1000$ is steeeeeeep!!!! 


id never spend that much, but i agree looks can be deceiving. its is comfortable, im not sure 1000$ of comfort but you never really feel bad uncomfortable, nor do you feel super comfy. its for people that i think.....dont want to think about there chair. i dunno

cLBGKqcqJmg,"My workplace uses the Herman Miller Aeron chairs....I am not a fan.  I developed knee pain after only a few months of work, which I believe was due to the design of the chair bottom.  I was only 22 at the time and haven't had the pain ever since refusing to use the Aeron chair (35 now).  It is entirely possible I needed a small sized chair and my office only orders medium and large, but I'm not about to ask management to special order a $1,000 chair that I might end up hating when I already have one that works fine.

On a side note, one of our satellite offices uses the less expensive Herman Miller Celle chairs, which I find much more comfortable than the pricier Aeron's.",0,Nick,2020-09-28 00:39:21+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

I am considering a new chair and been looking at all sorts of full back chairs but I always seem to keep coming back to the secret lab titan even though I was looking at spending a lot less than the price tag of the titan. I have to ask, as the armrests are plastic, how comfortable are they? As I have always had padded armrests on my chair and unsure if plastic will be comfortable or not.

cLBGKqcqJmg,"Everyone at my workplace sits on Aerons. I have been using one for about 2 years.
Is it a good chair? Absolutely, it's comfortable, and adjustable in _almost_ every way, the mesh material breathes, the build quality is extraordinary, and there's a 12 year warranty.

Would I buy it? Hahahahahaha... absolutely not, it's imho overpriced as hell. I'm not in the chair design and manufacturing business, but I find it very hard to justify that price tag. Maybe making a chair that good costs this much, but I doubt it.

What's my gripe with ""gaming"" chairs? Well _most_ of them are just plain garbage, because they're not really adjustable, and have zero lumbar support. The Secretlab Titan is one of the exceptions, having lumbar support, but its height is not adjustable, which concerns me (I'm about 5'5"" or 168cm tall, and the Titan is meant for 175cm and up).",0,TheVico87,2020-09-16 13:33:18+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

cLBGKqcqJmg,"So, I am an Aeron chair owner watching your video :P Since you seem to be interested in why someone who owns one would watch your video, I'll give you some background. I'm a gamer and occasional streamer whose job is teaching remote IT classes, so my job and most of my hobbies revolve around sitting in a chair for 12+ hours a day. People spend a crapton of money on things like furniture, clothes, decorations, alcohol that give you nothing tangible long-term. That's fine. An uncomfortable chair however gives you something very tangible; back pain. The Aeron solved that issue for me. However, I'm considering a SecretLab Titan XL for my game room as it speaks to the nerd in me more.

First, the reason why a lot of people recommend the Aeron chair is because it's used commonly in the office space by a great many companies and the people who work at these types of companies (and likely get to use these chairs at work) can't afford them at home and are looking for the next best thing. Your 5/10 however is not the kind of review that tells me (and likely anyone else) that it's anywhere close however, so people recommended a jump in quality/cost. A lot of people commented recommending it because they assume that you must make enough money to buy one if you're popular enough of an influencer that Secret Labs is asking you to shill (which I'm glad you didn't).


Second, the seat and back of an Aeron aren't made of cloth. They're this weird mesh weave stuff; think of it like a hammock, only more comfortable. Because they don't use fabric, they don't really collect smells or moisture the same way cloth does. These chairs are so often used in the workplace that you can frequently get them very cheap; I've seen some as cheap as $300 with all the bells and whistles and they can be a hell of a lot easier to find right now during covid. I can't get a Titan XL for the life of me right now. Anyway, for leather and stuff with this mesh weave style, I would personally feel comfortable getting it used. A chair with fabric though? No way in hell.

Regardless, your review sounds promising as a possible secondary chair as the way the back is shaped definitely suits my chair and your chair well. You didn't change your 5/10 rating in this followup, so I'm curious what you would rate this chair today and is it still holding up over a year out?",0,mph8er,2020-09-15 00:41:24+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

So one problem I had was the back not square. It leaned to the left. So I tried to follow the steps they sent me (youtube video how-to), and lo and behold, one of the mounting bolts that attaches the seat to the back was stuck and would not come out. I ever so carefully attempted to slowly back it out by hand and IT TORQUED IN HALF. Snapped. SO BUMMED!! I love this chair, but man, sitting with the back causing a slight lean back on the left side is disappointing. Gotta wonder what kind of cheap pot metal chinese crap they are using for the hardware, as these bolts are not thin or flimsy and I was surprised I was able to snap it in half simply by attempting to loosen it using a simple wrench.

However I do think if they're gonna charge so much they should put more time in making it aesthetically pleasing. 
Top executives at google and Microsoft  have those chairs.
From what I hear what makes them so great is the amount of adjustability  and support.
Most think the more cushiony the chair is the more comfortable  however if that's the case you could just buy one of those plush leather office chairs from walmart  but after 8 hours you'll be regretting ever spending money on it. Do to lack of lumbar support.

And while it is expensive there is a longevity aspect to it(If the chairs last around their warranties you come out dead even in replacements, and the Aeron is known to go well past the 12 year warranty), as well as the fact that they are made in the USA and not China/Taiwan/Some other outsourcing country, and the fact that they are well designed comfortable chairs that have a huge reputation in the workspace for both aesthetics and long term comfort/health.",0,Brandon Furuyama,2020-08-28 01:05:32+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

cLBGKqcqJmg,"I am looking into a SecertLabs chair myself and this is where my contention is. I have an Aeron at work and love it, it works great and I can find used ones for around $400. However I like the styling and general aesthetic more from SecretLabs, but I'm worried about the support/comfort.

I think the reason you saw so many Aeron comments is because you can find a used one usually around $400. They are excellent chairs and last 10-15 years easy. I used to work in an Operations Center where we had 24/7 coverage and the workers union required Aeron chairs for all of the employees. It was for good reason, those things are VERY comfortable and super adjustable to all sizes and needs.

cLBGKqcqJmg,"Not lying here but I didn‚Äôt expect something soft, I really wanted something firm but not too hard. I just received my Titan XL yesterday, and my first sit down, I actually bounced a bit. Keep in mind I kinda let myself plop down on it. Now, I‚Äôm a big guy, tall and wide. I gamed all night, about 8-9 hours and I experienced no pain whatsoever. Usually I can only handle 3-4 hours max of gaming at anytime because of how much other chairs hurt me. This chair though was like a dream come true and I have rarely ever been more proud in a purchase that I‚Äôve made. 

Is it for every big person out there? Well I guess that comes down to personal preference if you prefer soft or firm. This chair however, if it makes any sense at all is a bit of both but more so on the supportive side. It‚Äôs more than I could ever have  hoped for. 

I hate giving in to hype, not very often are things worth the hype or the price. With this chair though, I believe, in my honest opinion that it is worth it‚Äôs hype and price. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs at peak price/performance.",0,d y s p h o r i c,2020-08-21 21:57:02+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

cLBGKqcqJmg,Honestly I love hearing that's it's firm and not like cloud. I've heard other reviewers claim that it almost 'hugs' your back and would be interested to hear if you agree with this. I'm a software engineer and doctoral researcher so spend an inordinate amount of time working on a computer so it's great to hear that it's comfortable to sit in without ruining your back - anything that helps keep your back straight and upright is a big tick in my opinion. I have pre-ordered one as they seem to be low on stock in the UK and looking forward to seeing how fast they get it out to me (apparently 21st September or earlier).,1,Nathaniel G.

My previous PU brandless chair started peeling within the first few months.. Mostly was because Im used to sitting on it without my shirt on. And in Singapore, you can also perspire, sitting in an Aircon room. Our greasy perspiration kills the PU over time.

cLBGKqcqJmg,"Those Herman Miller Aeron chairs are actually well more than $1,000 USD when you option them out fully. I've had one that I bought used that dated back to the 1990's. It lasted about 4 or 5 years after I bought it about 10 years ago. I chucked it about three years ago. I bought a Secret Labs Titan to replace an Ergohuman ME7ERG, which after 8 years is disintegrating on me. That company was absolutely horrendous for warranty claims. Basically, they don't ever respond. 

I've had my Titan for a little over a week, so I haven't much to say about it. It's the PU Leather 2.0 Dark Knight Edition. So far, seems very high quality. The ass padding is really very firm. Much more so than I'd have liked. However, I have a pretty bad back and the chair seems fantastic on that front. One reason I opted for the Titan is that it has an integrated lumber support like automotive seating rather than some lame lumbar pillow.",0,Dan Dobrowolski,2020-08-17 20:48:37+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

Was so much better I use it for work as well and now I just pre-ordered the Titan Cyber Punk edition (I liked the colors ok!)  Titan is much better chair and the head support is built in.

For the money, Secret Lab is much better and well worth the money. 1 year of use no issues with Secret Lab. 7 years of use on Herman Miller no issues either.

cLBGKqcqJmg,"Love the review, I was already deliberating between the Titan and an HM Aeron for home working when I stumbled across your channel. I gotta call you out on the Aeron fanboy criticism though, based on real life experience. I work in an industry where operators sit at consoles for up to 18 hours a shift. The chairs themselves are shared, in constant 24/7 use, and get absolutely abused by the users. Since switching to Aerons about a decade ago nearly everyone has fallen in love with them for the comfort and lack of back pain - in fact our H&S people don't like operators sitting on anything else for long shifts. The office staff get plain old office chairs and finding an ""ex ops"" Aeron to steal for the office is like gold dust! The ""grannies tights"" mesh is fantastic at keeping you cool and letting ""bodily vapours"" dissipate. It's the only chair I'd consider buying second hand as a result, as it doesn't have a stinky foam core to absorb all that yuck. I have no idea how good the 12-year aeron warrany is, but I see plenty of 10+ year old ones floating around in regular use still (you can tell they are older by the different lumbar support). 

All of that considered, I'm probably still going to buy a Titan softweave - because I like how it looks and I find the price & colourways of the Aeron a bit stiff for home use. 2nd hand ones are good value but rarely in any colour other than black. I'll still be glad to sit on an Aeron when I get back to work though.",3,David,2020-07-31 12:19:56+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

cLBGKqcqJmg,"Hey Stu, great review! I wanted to give my 2 cents to the aeron thing. Also, wanted to give you a bit more perspective on where all these people are coming from. The thing is, most people are extremely apprehensive about anything labelled as ""gaming"" (myself included). This tag is often used in a way that aims to milk out as much as possible from a very big and lucrative market and resulting in cheap and mostly not-very-durable things being shipped out in expensive and glittery packaging. A wide variety of stuff like ""gaming headsets"", gaming this gaming that, have flooded the market which are mostly subpar in quality at best. Most gaming chairs are not an exception. Anyone saying aeron is worth it, is not lying or has been paid by herman miller to do so. I have these in my office and I don't think I've ever sat on a more comfortable chair in my life. These are not old people chair. The complete changeover from sitting on a cushion to a mesh changes everything you remember about sitting on an office chair. It feels like sitting on those folding beach chairs with extremely soft cloth where you just sink in but still feel fully secure and supported. Now since ive been working from home, I miss these TERRIBLY. I have been looking at slightly cheaper alternatives as these make a HUGE dent in the pocket for sure (US$1200 for me). Someone suggested me secret labs omega so i started digging about this company. So far so good. Although, I will be keeping an eye out for a deal on aeron as someone in my discord was able to get a pretty sweet deal on a brand new aeron ($600) with their local seller. I'd say if you can afford it, go for aeron. The only drawback I see with aeron is a lack of headrest which is fairly important for me in a gaming chair.",0,addyaustin,2020-07-27 05:53:58+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

cLBGKqcqJmg,"I literally just unboxed and assembled my Omega (also in the same soft weave) and I'm sitting on it for the first time right now as I watch this. I also went for the fabric over PU leather due to cracking issues with my previous chair (Cougar Armour - don't buy). During assembly I was impressed with the quality and how solid everything looks and feels. As for the quibble about the underside of the chair and the edge/wrap of the upholstery - this is nearly identical to the seats you would find in a car. If you go out and unbolt the front seat of your vehicle and flip it over you'll see the same finishing and hog rings. Anyway, I can't fault them for the part I'll never look at. It's definitely FIRM and that's GOOD because as you mentioned back issues are a big thing and I was having trouble with nearly every other chair in my house. I'm glad to hear you say after 9 months your back is doing well because that's the whole reason I spent over $500 CAD on this Secretlab.

I'm a bigger guy as well which is one of the main reasons I was drawn to the Titan and my back has been great since I got it. I like the adjustability of the chair a lot because I can dial everything in if I'm playing a more competitive game or drop it down and back a bit if I'm just playing a casual title.

I think if it were softer it probably wouldn't last like it does. It's basically a bucket seat from a car. If I could get them to change anything immediately it would be to powder coat the aluminum frame base that the wheels plug into. If I'm just casually at my PC I have a tendency to put my feet up on the frame and had already scratched it to shit within the first week. Not a huge deal and something I could easily fix myself but it's the one thing that shows age on my chair.

Those wire mesh chairs are pretty popular right now. Never heard of that brand but even other models by other companies are usually very expensive because too many idiots are happily  paying the price of a 2080ti for a chair that not even upholstered.

cLBGKqcqJmg,"I think the primary reason why people enjoy the aeron and similar office chairs is because they are usually quite cheap as refurbished chairs and have a vast network of spare parts available. Therefore you could in theory use the same chair for decades and exchange parts that may wear down. Looks shouldn't really be your main concern either, it should simply be down to how comfortable you feel in it. There are plenty of brands other than Herman Miller that also produce office chairs constructed with ergonomics in mind. None of these companies have yet landed on the racing bucket seat for a product. Therefore people are very sceptic about this approach. It all comes down to if you trust the office chair companies who have existed for 50+ years or the gaming chair company who all source the same parts from one manufacturer in China and slap their own branding on it.",0,Freeze,2020-07-10 23:36:02+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

cLBGKqcqJmg,"I bought an Omega early 2019, cost just under 600 AUD shipped. Before it even arrived I felt like I had made a bad decision at that price.
But when it arrived, oh boy. Firm, solid and quiet. The packaging alone was amazing. I fell asleep in it reclined on the third day. My back has never felt better and posture trained itself without me putting any thought into it. I will admit, the side bolsters on the seat seemed a bit too firm in the beginning, but I guess my ass was used to sitting in pillows for years, and after a couple of days I didnt even notice it anymore. 
I've used it daily for about 16 or so months now and the leather has not peeled or cracked anywhere. The stitching is still the same as day one. The only damage is on a back corner from me spinning into my desk constantly. and the armrests have loosened up a fair bit due to me using them too much.

That's it. It's not mega ergonomic, sitting in it for hours in an unusual desk setup like mine where my desk is abnormally high up so my feet won't touch the ground because I have to raise my chair up to get my arms inline with my keyboard, it's not as comfortable as the Aeron knockoffs at my office. But for looks, general comfort and so-far build quality, it's nice.",John Buscher,0,2020-07-30 06:10:15+00:00
cLBGKqcqJmg,"I doubt Herman Miller is that worried about Secret Lab. They're a pretty big supplier for companies, which is why they're so much more expensive - they're meant for much tougher use than a regular consumer chair. (Think places like call centers or offices with round-the-clock shifts.) I wouldn't be surprised if the people pushing the Aeron worked somewhere that had them. I worked at a larger company that used them for their ergonomic option. Looks aside, the chair was pretty highly regarded when it came out because of its ergonomics. They're not very comfortable in my opinion, though. Plus that knit mesh tends to sand through your clothes over time.",0,BlackJavaBean,2020-07-10 11:26:50+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan
cLBGKqcqJmg,"Yo, got my Titan back in September 2018. They've made upgrades since then to this chair from my understanding. The plastic arms of the chair (the one holding the armrests) are wobbly as hell, pretty much in a very very negative way. The soft rubbery parts of the armrests (where the arms lie) is torn on the right one. This was due to fairly heavy use and squishing them to check firmness over a long period of time. Pillow's soft rubber strap is basically done, but I was touching it often as it was satisfyingly soft. Chair itself has no peeling yet, and I am from Texas where my room and outside temps can get pretty high. Almost 2 years of use and only a little bit of cleaning in all this time, it's still looking pretty cool overall. I have the all black PU version. 

There is some wear and tear, but the main body of the chair is doing fantastic for the heavy usage I've put it through. I have to agree with most of the things in this review, especially the money part. Unless I landed a job with a solid salary of around $100k USD per/yr, this is about as much as I'm spending on a chair. This is a good chair, not the absolute greatest, but a solid choice in the market where you shouldn't really feel bad about buying. 

Definitely one of the more stylish options.",2,treymtz,2020-07-10 06:14:36+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

I have had two free replacements of the piston/tilt systems where I accidently forgot to change my address and it got lost (as it was sent through an air-force base) so they decided to send another one express to my current address so I could get back up and running.

cLBGKqcqJmg,"I use my chair about 10-12 hours every day for both work and after work gaming sessions. I have spent 1.000 ¬£ on an ergonomic office chair before and have never been so disapointed on spending that kind of money on anything. These chairs have no headrest and generaly they will start hurting after a few hours of sitting in them simply because they force you to sit up straight all the time and you can't really relax in them.
I own a Perseus ADJ chair for 2 years now (https://www.adjbenelux.com/adj-perseus-gaming-chair-black-red.html) and it is a massive improvement on the ergonomic chair that costed 5x the price of the one I own. Quality wise, yeah OK, it's a 200¬£ chair and after 2 years the rubber armrests are starting to give in and the foam in the seat is starting to wear down. But I never regreted changing from expensive ergonomic seat to a (much cheaper) gaming seat.  The comfort of use by being able to rest your head against something just far outways the 'perfect' seating position of an ergonomic chair if you sit in it for more than a few hours.
I am 100% considering a Secretlab chair. I don't like very soft seating anyway, so that would be no issue for me. And if it lasts for around 5 years for the price of 426 EUR / 388 ¬£ (current price for a Softweave fabric Titan 2020)...I would consider that a very good deal. And they look very nice too. I'll watch some more video reviews before buying one, but so far all the reviews I've seen are ranging between possitive with one or two afterthoughts and 'best chair I ever used'.

And $136.40 AUD is still very fair for the replacement part of the seat in my opinion also, but I'm going the super cheap approach first. If it doesn't permanently fix the issue I'll just but the replacement seat bum part.",0,Citizen Tech Talk,2020-06-14 12:31:17+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

cLBGKqcqJmg,"I like how the 1,099 pound chair has 4/5 stars on that website.  If I ever spent that much money on a chair, it damn well better be a perfect 5 out of 5.  As to why everyone on the internet says to buy one, I think it's because a) they're obscenely comfortable -- I sat in a used one and it was more comfortable than any chair I've ever been in, I just didn't feel comfortable spending $400-500 on a refurbished product; b) you can get them refurbished for around the same cost as this chair; and c) based on how good that ancient used one I sat on still looked and held up, they last way, way, way longer than any chair that's cheaper.
I will absolutely get one when I'm rich enough to spend a new bed's worth of money on a chair.  I really should, considering I spend equal amounts of time in both.",0,Andrew Kelly,2020-06-13 17:33:06+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

In the office I get back issues but in the Titan- not a twitch, I also love the 4d armrests (canting them in seems to help a lot for me).  It's more awesome than a big bag of awesome.

Now if you could do a video on how to sweet talk Health and Safety into getting a Titan for me in the office (if I ever see that mystical place again) then that would be super :D

Seriously though it's amazing. Companies buy them by the hundreds for their employees for a reason. Increased productivity because they're comfortable. It didn't become the most popular chair ever because it isn't good. The one you showed is the stripped down version of the old design. They can look much much better. If sitting at a desk is your job, you absolutely shouldn't skimp on a chair. It's an investment in your health. After having a mesh chair I couldn't go back to a standard cold formed foam chair.

cLBGKqcqJmg,"The reason ppl recommend that Herman Miller chair is that it‚Äôs a professional office chair designed for 8+ hrs of sitting in and working. + It‚Äôs built like a tank, and has one of if not the most adjustable sitting positions. Now I don‚Äôt own this chair and I‚Äôm sure not everyone that hyped it does. But a friend of mine does, and I‚Äôve sat in it for extended periods of time, and can attest to its quality. I also happened to have ordered, and now own a Secret Labs Titan XL Softweave Charcoal Blue (which came with a damaged base, that I‚Äôm now waiting for a replacement). So I‚Äôm not really biased or shilling for Herman Miller, but it is the top of its class, and if you have the money, definitely worth every penny. I wish I could afford it, but decked out with a head rest, in the US that thing is over $1200 (X-chair makes a decent knock-off version of the Herman Miller, but it‚Äôs not the same. Nor cheap either).

cLBGKqcqJmg,"Although the price of the Aeron (and other chairs like it) is extreme, there are plenty of reasons why they are the top of the line. Now whether or not they actually justify the price, that's another question and in my own opinion, they don't. However they're made more for businesses than the ordinary consumer as they know the vast majority of people will just buy normal everyday chairs, not high end ergonomics and therefore they don't need to worry about pricing as much and can afford a premium price tag as big businesses will invest in them for their employees if needed. It's the same as any business oriented products. Is the standard person going to buy a 5000 dollar graphics card for a pc that isn't even good at running video games? God no. But businesses that need them for data analysis, scientific modelling or extensive real time rendering will easily fork out that money. 
.
Chairs like the Leap, Aeron, Embody and so forth are considered the best for a reason and are in many ways a superior chair to the Titan. However at three times the price, the price/performance may be a lot worse. I do agree though that people coming in basically bragging about their great high end chairs is stupid and either they're wanting to just show off their chair or knowledge or they got one, weren't happy with it and now go to other reviews of cooler looking chairs to put them down trying to make themselves feel better. 
.
All this said though, your notion of second hand chairs being nasty make no sense. You sit on buses, trains and planes. You sit in other people's cars, in used cars, on other people's furniture and chairs, in waiting rooms, in classrooms as a kid or in college, in office chairs in work and all of these have one thing in common usually...they've had many other people sometimes hundreds, thousands or millions of people sitting on them, farting and whatever else. But you don't care about them? It's a stupid argument and completely illogical. You can also steam clean them or clean them with whatever best suits the material or buy refurbished which have had that done to it previously though at an extra cost.
.
Anywho, the titan seems like a pretty cool chair but there is a reason that it's the price it is when compared to the others. It definitely looks the best by a mile. It's not even close. The thing is like a throne. But there are technological advances in certain high end chairs that make it a bit more understandable as to why they're the price they are, even if they look rather plain or like a normal everyday chair you'd buy for 50 quid. And at the end of the day, no one chair is suited for every person and a lot of it is subjective but THAT is the very reason why some high end chairs such as a Steelcase gesture or leap are so beloved.

As someone who has suffered bad lower back pain for decades, rather than years, I'm slightly surprised at your disappointment of the firmness. Medics, aka those who know better than I do, have told me for as long as I remember that a soft seat is far worse than a firm one, so it makes sense that a firmer chair would be better for our backs. I would also say that like many people I have bought pillows, massagers, oinments and creams, physio treatments and all sort of gadgets for pain relief, extending well into 4 figures, I don';t think it's expensive at all. I've also seem and bought chairs costing up to ¬£250 which have been total crap. 

I also like the idea of the additional 2 year guarantee for a recommendation, in a world where everyone you buy from online expects you to fill in a survey in your time for absolutely nothing in return it's a refreshing change. It's hard in a world of what sometimes feels like almost infinite competition. Even worse are the firms that are charging you an extra hundred quid for an extra two years warranty, and at least it shows that Secretlabs have enough confidence in their product to make the offer. 

At 5'6"" and 175 pounds I'll probably go for the ¬£329 Omega, and if it helps my back even 20% and helps me do more as a result it will pay for itself in any event. Your review has helped a lot.",0,severn sea,2020-06-02 12:22:36+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan
cLBGKqcqJmg,"I have this identical chair, in the same material and color, and about the same age (delivered 9/6/19). I agree that it's much firmer than I expected, and I was initially disappointed too. For a while I put a memory foam seat cushion on it, but I've since removed that and decided to just get used to the firmness. Mostly it has been fine, but I do wish there was a bit more cushion in the bottom. Like you, I really appreciate the firmness of the back - that part is remarkably comfortable even after a very long day in the chair (8 hours working, then 4 hours gaming or browsing).

I've removed the arm rests, because even at their lowest setting, they were too tall for me, and when my arms were resting on them, my shoulders were hunched up - it caused me some shoulder and neck pain, so I removed them. It's nice that they can be easily unbolted.

My chair has also gotten creakier than it was. It still feels very solid, it's not falling apart or anything, but now when I shift in it, the back makes squeaking noises that it didn't when it was new.

Overall, I agree with your evaluation. I still wish the bottom was just a little softer though.",0,Tchad Rogers,2020-06-02 05:04:15+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

cLBGKqcqJmg,"Risking a good old lambast here, but I have a 2nd hand Aeron (bought in Australia for $800 AUD which is equivalent of about 25 quid). It's a  great chair, but is it the best chair of all time? 

Not really, I would never use it at home when chilling at the PC, but I like having it at the office. The arms are super annoying (they constantly, slowly drop down about 2-3 times over the course of a working day, and they flap around a bunch when simply using them normally), the actual wheels / frame kind of jank around when you move (it's mostly fine when you're still) and the adjustments are nonsensical. The quality of nan's mesh is really good, it's soft but solid. The reason it's so expensive is it's made in the USA. 

I'm currently using the Neuechair by Secretlab, which is actually trash. I sold my Omega and bought it thinking it would be actually good, but it's garbage. The mesh is so soft you kind of sink into it and the lumbar support is painful. 

Right now I'm trying to track down a Steelcase Leap because it has another cult following like the Aeron. Unfortunately no one has them for sale used in Australia and buying them through a dealer is $1,300+. Has anyone here tried the Leap V2?",0,Dave Curro,2020-05-29 02:01:55+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

cLBGKqcqJmg,"herman miller chairs do come with a 10 year parts and labor warranty on their products no strings bassically. That said I thought the areon felt uncomfortable, but that's a subjective opinion. I was looking at used areon's and Steel series Leap chairs and the areon""s seemed to hold up better parts wise in most regards but the leap was more comfortable for me even more so than the embody.  There are plenty of reasonable alternatives online tho like the ergochair or one i tried that i honestly thought was better than any of the others was a 400$ the ""workpro 1200"" from office depot. In reality ""race car"" style seats if you can call them that were not designed too hold your body in a healthy position for extended periods (Laman's 24hr race car seat's show how different a seat designed for that task would be). The side effects of prolonged poor posture are slow to build up and like developing unequal muscle groups when body building; very hard to correct later.

Great video and honest review, I myself was taken aback with how firm the chair is when I got it but you get used to it eventually. Overall I would give their support team a 10/10 for help and the chair itself a 9/10 and would probably get again if I needed another chair.

I've also bought myself a DXRacer King series back in 2016 and while I love that chair too, the leather is starting to wear now. However, I do find it slightly more comfortable than the Secret Lab Titan. Unfortunately, ever since the mounting of that chair, it makes a lot of bad noise whenever I sit on its lowest level... like, a lot of cracking sounds.

Another plus with the DXRacer King would be the two cushions given with it. One for the neck and another one for the lower back. I find these more comfortable than the Titan's.

cLBGKqcqJmg,"I'm actually watching this review because I'm trying to choose between the Titan and the Steelcase Gesture. Or the Steelcase Leap.

And, yes, Steelcase are 1000 dollar chairs. If you do your research there's a reason people recommend them & Herman Miller... It's not shilling, people are just getting very serious and cork sniffy with their chairs now. Think of any enthusiast market where people buy into the high end equipment. Vinyl records, guitars, headphones, etc... High end materials, for sure, but the necessity is debatable. 

Personally, I still don't know what to get. The Titan does seem a bit low quality for the price. The Gesture is more than I want to pay. And I'm with you, I would never buy a used chair. No way. But it's hard for me to accept that a gaming chair isn't just... junk. People pay 1000 for a new mattress every couple of years, a chair seems like a better investment. These gaming chairs all come out of the same factory.

If I could get a new Steelcase for around 800 I'd be very tempted, but I'd be sweating the whole time during checkout. There's also the Autonomous Ergochair2, which tries to provide a Steelcase/Herman Miller style chair at a cheap price... But the price definitely reflects the reviews, usually with the seat cushion being the weak link. I'd be interested in seeing your review on the Ergochair2. It's cheaper than the Titan.

Right now the Steelcase Gesture is my top pick, but I really do wish I could find something more affordable. The Ergochair2 is a contender, but the reviews all seem fake. The Titan seems like the best gaming chair, sturdy and all, but it's still a gaming chair and not designed for ergonomics... The chair market is obnoxiously frustrating. I've pretty much thrown my hands up in the air at this point. I just want to move on from OfficeDepot chairs, they're pure rubbish.

great review / Recap, I agree the first time you sit on this chair it is so much harder than expected.  But I fully agree with you that this chair saves so much pain in the long run! only pitty i find is that the armwrest can only be adjusted forward and back, but not more inward and outward.

to my question: You were mentioning another youtuber (and maybe you experienced yourself) who had a complaint about the tip of seat(where your knee meets the chair) where there is a little incline in height, it feels to me I need to put the chair lower in order for my legs not to get hurt. Is this a complaint you have seen before? it seems like this youtuber you quoted in your movie found the same problem. 

Also I am curious if you understand why this part of the chair is a bit inclined compared to the rest of this chair.",0,Paul van Renselaar,2020-05-15 14:51:00+00:00,There is a button on the inside middle of the armrests to adjust inward/outward and another to angle them inside front.,JOHN DEMPSEY,0,2020-06-10 06:41:47+00:00

cLBGKqcqJmg,"Softweave is good.
Don't bother with PU leather.
I have a Secretlab and the PU started peeling after 9 months. They replaced it for $50. But if I could, I would have gone back and gotten a Softweave.
And that's what I'll be doing in a year's time, when this replacement PU begins to peel again.",0,Mystery Notes,2020-05-15 11:24:59+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan
cLBGKqcqJmg,"My office has HM Aeron chairs and I bought the Titan a month ago and I prefer the Titan. I'm 190cm and I find the lumbar support for the Aeron pokes into my hips and is really uncomfortable and not supportive. The Titan is better in this regard, for me at least. I find the Titan a bit wobbly when you raise the seat up high though, which is probably my biggest gripe.",0,Chris Paton,2020-05-15 10:51:23+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan
cLBGKqcqJmg,"Thought I'd chime in here. I have had my PU leather Titan 2020 since January and I did have to deal with customer support. I send them that my backrest was feeling somewhat 'off'. They responded rather quickly and when I provided them with a picture and a video showing some squeaking, like some parts were moving individually they immediately recognized that it was faulty and send me a new backrest for free.
Personally I love the ass rest for it's firmness. Overall it's a good chair. I love the functionality of the 5D armrests (although beware, I've read some comments online that the inner mechanisms are made of plastic so I wonder how they will hold up as time goes by). However, the arm rests, due to the functionality are somewhat wobbly, so if you are a gamer that mostly rests both arms on the armrest this wobbling can get annoying in certain positions. 
Keep in mind though like with many things the prize premium you pay does not directly correlate with the quality you get. A 400eu chair is not 4 times as good as an Ikea 100eu chair. Initially this did disappoint me somewhat as I also expected it to be more like a cloud. I have also read a lot of differing claims of things awry, ranging from the tilting mechanism, to the seat part's sagging down to the backrest individual parts shifting up, so keep that in mind.
The +2 years warranty for sharing it on social media is despicable though",11,Sinz,2020-05-15 08:33:38+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

I didn't have the quality issue with the fabric that Stu had - this thing arrived flawless and is built like a tank. It is definitely the firmest chair I've owned and way firmer than office chairs. The firmness won't be everybody's cup of tea, but my back and neck love it. I can and have sat in this thing for 16hr stretches. Also, this chair is nearly identical to the Noblechairs Epic. I think the only difference is the seat covering and some cosmetic differences. That said, if I'd had a $1,200 budget, I'd have gone for a Steelcase Leap V2.

When you're in school, you sit on chairs that hundreds of people have used day in, day out. When you sit in college, same deal. When you sit on a chair in work, half the time it will be a chair that many others have sat on in the past. Same goes for sitting on the bus, sitting in a waiting room, going to a friends house and sitting on their furniture. Hell when you sit on your own damn furniture, other people from your own family have been sitting and farting on it. What about toilets? Every time you use your toilet, someone else from your family or your boyfriend/girlfriend etc. has sat on it and done their business numerous times. Public toilets (which I'm not a fan of myself) are even worse yet you've probably used them. Also any kind of bacteria or virus that could possibly be present will be long dead by the time you get your chair and set it up.

cLBGKqcqJmg,"Just to clear the air about Herman Miller. It's about long term investment. In the long run a Herman Miller will last much longer than a secret lab chair or any gaming chair for that matter. The Herman Miller will come with a 12 year warranty. It's like buying a mattress, if you spend a good portion of your life sleeping it's probably better to spend a good amount of money on a good matrress. Same goes for a chair if you work from home or spend a lot of time in a chair. $1000 is very reasonable for the length of time the chair will last and the comfort. Mesh might look odd at first but is vastly superior in my opinion to leather or cloth due to it being more breathable. At the end of the day it's your money so your choice but don't write off a very good chair because of a high initial price tag without exploring why there is that price.",1,luc bridwell,2020-05-12 07:22:48+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

cLBGKqcqJmg,"I live in Malaysia and I've got a DxRacer Drifting Series chair. It's a nice gaming chair but I was extremely disappointed because the PU leather started to peel and flake after less than 1.5 years of use. And now after 4 years, almost 90% of the PU on the seat has flaked off. I guess the chair is allergic to the hot and humid weather in Malaysia. I've been eyeing the secretlab Titan for a while now, but undecided for fear that the same would happen even with it's new Prime 2.0 technology. Thanks for your review, I guess my next purchase would be the Titan with softweave fabric. Just hope that I don't spill coffee on it.",0,Gary Yeow,2020-05-11 11:46:55+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

cLBGKqcqJmg,"Hello fellow humans, I just wanted to share my expirience in general and with the Secretlab customer service. I did a lot of research which includes Stu`s review about (gaming) chairs and office chairs and in the end I decided to buy one of Secretlabs Titan beacuse it provides all I expect from a good chair (Back support, durability, looks) eventhough I  didnt want to pay more then 250‚Ç¨ at the beginning of my research. But if you want to have a good product you need to spent more money in most of the cases at least I am telling it to myself right now. So I rodered my chair more then 3 weeks ago and after a confirmation Mail from Secretlab i got no more email or Fedex link or anything after more then 2 weeks after buying. So I wrote a ticket to them where my chair is and if there are any prob with delivering to my country beacuse of corona. I mean i paid 400‚Ç¨ and no contact in about  2 weeks, that made me a bit nervous but I have to say i preordered beacuse it was out of stock so they had still enought time to deliver the chair. But like 2 hours after i wrote the ticket i got an answer. They guy told me that everything is on schedule and he resent my order to Fedex and that they are trying their best to deliver as soon as possible. Now i get my chair 5 days earlier then scheduled, idk if that has something to do with my e - mail but still it was an fast and friendly response. It should be delivered today at 6 pm and I hope I do not regret buying one of this chairs xd.",1,Floji,2020-05-11 09:39:27+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

It is by no means a super comfy chair but I was never uncomfortable in it even when I was on it hours on end. In fact, I didn't know how much it costs until I looked it up. It is definitely in a different price range than SecretLab products, but the quality is remarkable.

cLBGKqcqJmg,"I‚Äòve gotten mine a few weeks back an can totally confirm that it is quite firm, but not as firm as I expected it to be after seeing your initial review. It‚Äôs actually more comfortable to sit in for long hours because of this ‚Äúbalanced firmness‚Äù and - like in your case - it‚Äôs relieved my back-pain. It‚Äôs not gone, but A LOT better. Something to keep in mind if you‚Äôre thinking about getting this chair and are a guitarist (or bassist) thinking about getting this to record in: the armrest are quite large and will require you to sit on the first half of the seat to properly hold and play the instrument, so you won‚Äôt be touching the backrest and in turn get no support from it while playing.

cLBGKqcqJmg,"I have had one for just over a month now. I agree with every point made. My only gripe is with models.

I wanted/needed the features of the Titan (low sides for the seat, width for the shoulders, lumbard support that can be adjusted) but I have the height for an Omega (172cm). Point is I needed the depth of the seat for the Omega, but all the features of the Titan so I had to make a choice. I decided for the Titan, but the back of my knees now scrape the edge of the seat.

Since I bought the titan despite being shorter than the recommended height (I  prefer more room space), I'd in my case require a lumbar pillow, and it works well because I can fully flatten the chair out. Please try the chair out before making any purchasing decision, p.s, bought it for 6 months now, still perfectly fine, and been loving it ever since.",Nigel Tan,0,2020-05-11 05:03:18+00:00
cLBGKqcqJmg,"Great review and very in depth, it cleared up a few things and even gave me a second opinion on the exact same questions you covered at least some of them. I also was sucked into the Herman Miller Aeron chair hype, I personally would never spend 900$ for the base version or more to modify it let alone purchase a second hand chair. You can build a decent enough computer your self for around 1k-1500$. I saw a specific website that deals in second hand Herman Miller chairs and when I did a little research I was shocked to see how bad the reviews were for the 3rd party dealer it self ""not the chair"". There were countless reviews of people getting screwed either by not receiving what they paid for or having a very poor customer service experience and possibly not receiving refunds etc. Anyway I kind of gave up on the Herman Miller brand mainly because of the price point. I used one of these for a few weeks while my work put me up in a Hilton Inn, I will say it was night and day, I'm pretty certain I could've slept in it.
As far as the Secret Labs chairs go I've had almost every chair with pleather, I really hate how hot I get in a full pleather chair and especially the cracking/peeling. I would be curious to see the longevity of the v2 pu leather but my previous experience with pleather chairs this may sway me towards the softweave version. I typically only ever purchase mesh chairs as I stay cooler and the only pleather I have to deal with is the arm/head rests which do tend to peel pretty badly, this current one is around 5-8 years of age and I spent 80$ on it. It was well worth the money and has only given me issues this last year as the main piston/axle broke which makes the chair lean back about 1-2 inches and the bottom is either flat or bowl shaped which makes you want to lean forward. This is killing my back which made me go on this hunt for a new quality chair, I've heard/read many reviews like you saying this one saves and is great for your posture in general.
I was surprised and this brand was even more appealing to me after seeing you can purchase the separate pieces when running into issues, I highly doubt any other brand does that other than those in the premium price point. I would think you'd have to send the entire thing back and get them to fix what ever was wrong but this makes it so much more convenient to fix and like you said the price for the separate pieces are pretty reasonable especially the bottom and back only being 50$.
Pardon any typos/mistakes as I wrote this being dead tired from being up like 36 hrs, I read it over but I was kinda glazing over lol.",0,Jakk Jakk,2020-05-10 08:25:57+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan
cLBGKqcqJmg,"Thank you for your very honest review, really appreciating it! I just had to make a decision between noblechairs Hero black edition and secretlab titan Pu/softweave. I would had go for the titan, but secretlab customer service mentioned in an email that if I don‚Äôt like it I can for sure send it back after 14 days but I have to pay the shipping cost. So i live in Germany and we have a secret lab HUB in Poland, which is managable.  But for what reason whatsoever they wanted to send it back to the UK hub.

I think the seat on the Omega is starting to wrinkle marginally now after 8 months, wondering how that situation will play out over the coming years.

cLBGKqcqJmg,"I've had my Titan for about nine months also.  I came from a DXRacer and when I first got it I hated it because it was so hard, and their conditions for extended warranty just annoyed me.  After some time I got used to the hardness and now actually prefer it, as Stu mentioned it does improve posture quite considerably and once my bum and back got used to it I now find it quite comfortable.  So, for anyone who is also disappointed with the firmness to the point of it hurting, my advise is just give it some time for your pathetic wimpy butt to adjust and man up.

I use a folded towel on my current chair, I think the fabric would be the way to go but am worried about how well it will handle the heat?

cLBGKqcqJmg,"I bought this chair hjh OFFICE, 608400, Executive Chair, professional office chair, swivel, PRO-TEC 400 from Amazon in 2017. Cost a little under ¬£400.
Looked good on screen and they said it's good for people upto 2.2m tall. That's over 7' tall and I'm about 6'2"". Only problems I have are with the seat base itself.
It's is way too short.  If I sit as far back as I can, about 1/4 to 1/3 of my thigh is not supported.
It cannot not tilt back. Though the backrest does.
Seat base feels like it's tilting forwards too.
And all the instructions are in German. They don't even bother to do an English translation for it.

So the next time I buy a chair, I'm going to go to a shop and buy one where I can test it first.
That's my only real suggestion when buying an office/gaming chair. Sit on one before hand and don't buy over the internet.
Oh! And the chair I bought before the hjh chair was a LANGRIA High Back PU Office Chair. Do not buy this chair. It's bloody awful. Cheap, tacky and really uncomfortable.

2. It inclines towards the back which is not good in an ergonomic pov and not good for blood circulation.

The design of a gaming chair (including secretlab) are all the same (with the exception of the titan that has a built in lumbar support which I will get to in a moment).  

1) backrest is a flat board that has wings and headrest area that curve in. couple with a pillow that puts you head and neck in a awkward position if you are sitting straight up.
2) built in lumbar support on backrest. the lumbar pushs out from the bottom of the backrest (your butt area) and forces your back to lean back into the mid and high area of the backrest. Good lumbar support will place that pressure in the middle of the small of the back 
3) you couple point 1) and point 2) and your body is in vary uncomfortable position regardless how you position the chair.
4) if you do not use the lumbar support....because of the curved nature of the top of the backrest you body forces you slowly into a hunch position. (if you head is moved/pushed forward and not aligned with your body the rest of your body will follow.
5) this chair design actually forces you to get your back of the backrest and lean into your desk..which defeats the purpose of ergonomics claimed by this chair.

I have to get up out of the chair within an hour. if I've been sitting on this chair for any amount of time I have to lay on my bed (I have a firm posturepedic bed) or the floor to stretch out. I don't think this is a matter of me getting use to the chair or bad posture on my part. The Herman Miller Aeron I used for 12 hours daily and when i retire at the end of the day I feel no pain I actually feel the same as when I got up in the morning to start my day.

This  chair is no better then any other low grade gaming chair just with better quality foam and PU leather and some pointless feature most people will never use (with the exception of the tilt) on a day to day basis.

a basic Ikea or staples ergo chair feels better then this chair.
I'll borrowed a Herman Miller Aeron when my original chair broke and was waiting on this chair. I will get rid of this chair and invest in a Herman Miller for home use.


the only positive I can give the chairs
1) solid constructions
2) great materials used (cured foam, PU leather
3) looks great

I work from home and game for a total of 12+ hours daily. the main reason for getting this chair was the comfort which is not there.",Edgar Domingo,0,2020-09-01 19:34:38+00:00

1YS-mFoTK5c,"A comment about what he said at 4:21 about the mattress.  If you think investing $400 in a better chair is worth it, I guarantee you investing money in a quality mattress is worth it.  I spent $2300 on a Sealy Beautyrest Black and by God that is the best money I ever spent.

But back to the chair.  My comment about the SecretLab Titan is that it's pretty good but does not seem to me to quite live up to its hype.  Everyone says its so comfortable and I don't really agree.  It's not UNcomfortable is what I'll say for it.  It's true it does not fatigue your body.  So if you put long hours into working, gaming, whatever at your workstation; you will feel good at the end of it.  Even after 5-6 hours straight I bounce out of it fresh.  That is a good aspect of it.  I would feel achy after that amount of time in my old chair.

But it's not what I'd call ""comfy.""  You can't relax in it.  I don't get the ""wow this is the best chair I've ever sat in"" feeling like so many reviewers seem to.

Ergo chair  base bottoms out but you can modify the foam for a better one easily.  After modifications on the ergochair I sit on the ergo more than the titan. Also you can‚Äôt return the chairs. I would recommend buying a chair from amazon so if you‚Äôre not satisfied you can return it.  I would return the titan if I could but can‚Äôt. I recently went to staples to test out their 400 chair and I think that chair is better than both the ergo and titan, but not as good as my modified ergo. The best part of buying a chair there is you can return it. Don‚Äôt fall for all the hype that these you tubers  are giving to these chairs, they were most likely sponsored by them.

The seat is only about 15‚Äù wide and the wings on the side of the seat are hard and will dig into your thighs if you try to spread your legs even a moderate amount. Everything else about this chair is amazing, but it‚Äôs sad to say that the wings on the seat brings this chair from a 9/10 to a 4/10. I trusted people‚Äôs positive reviews and bought this but I feel like I just got scammed. The only negatives that people mention are stupid things like logos, but no one seems to mention the factors that affect your everyday comfort. The seat itself is actually really soft and comfortable, idk why people are saying it‚Äôs stiff.

gGQtbDKmd3M,"Looking for reviews, i honestly clicked on the link of this video a couple of time but didn't thought i would listen to this entire 13 minutes video lol. But i did and damn i don't regret it. 2 things i have to say. First thing: you're doing an amazing job answering most questions that someone looking for a new chair has in mind so thank you and keep it up and if i decide to buy one, I'll check if i can do it with your link cuz you deserve it really much.
The second thing is more a question. Just like you, I'm fitting exactly between 2 chairs: throne and omega. And I'm afraid to do the wrong choice. Is there a really big difference of width of the backrest between the omega and titan? Or the difference is more on the seat itself (width and depth)? Without the pillow, omega seat depth would be little too long for me but i plan on using the said pillow so it's more about the width of backrest. As you said, arms could not fit perfectly depending on size of the person. Unfortunately i have no one nearby that could let me test their chair so it's a gambling but i assume increase of size between omega and titan should be proportional between throne and omega.

A thing that is important to know: if you never put the chair together, you can return it and they will give full refund. Only need to pay shipping back which i estimated to be roughly 30$CA for me. So i bought Omega and when i got it, i only pulled backrest out of box and asked someone to hold it in my back like if i was sitting in the chair just to make sure how it would feel once i would really sit against it. My idea would have been to ask a full refund if it wasn't feeling right. Backrest was ok so i did the same with seat. We concluded that with lumbar pillow, my knees would reach edge of seat just fine so i decided to keep it and put it together. If omega wouldn't have feeling right, i would have send it back and only lost 30$. And then i would have bought a throne instead. 30$ to test a 500$ chair that will last 10 years was a gamble i was fine to take ahahah",CmdoCake,1,2019-05-11 05:09:49+00:00

What helps me fit better the omega is fact that there is the pillow for lumbar support. Without it, i couldn't rest my back on the backrest cuz length of my legs would be slightly too short for my knee to reach the front edge of seat lol. The pillow makes the difference. Maybe without using it you could be fine? Anyway, the website offers pictures with some measures on them. Try to measure older chair you have and compare with those available on website. That's what i did. And if there are some additional measures missing on pictures that you would need to help you decide, I'll be glad to help you since now i own my very own omega eh eh eh ;)",CmdoCake,0,2019-05-11 04:51:52+00:00

Softweave obviously mostly because I hate leather and how it produces heat. That and light blue and black? All day,0,Zachary Manning,2019-01-01 07:59:50+00:00,"Oh snap, congrats buddy!! I haven't seen many of the the black/blue softweaves out there yet - I wanted to get that too!! xD Enjoy!",Mike Wat,1,2019-01-02 03:56:02+00:00

This is the only reason i have a hard time changing my chair, otherwise i would've taken this 2nd gen Omega because damm it looks great and it feels like it is as comfy as this IKEA one.

gGQtbDKmd3M,"Bravo on the review. I really liked how detailed this was. You have a great presentation style and I subbed just for that. Question; you said that you had a few different chairs in the past that failed to get rid of your back pain, though I noticed none of them were high quality racing chars, like the ones made by GTRacing or Killabee. Do you have any experience with these chairs to speak on them? I'm in the market for a new chair, and I'm wondering what sets these Secret Lab chairs apart from the others, especially because the GTRacer has a built foot rest at half the price.",0,The Blue Thunder Bunny,2018-12-28 06:18:37+00:00,"Thanks buddy! When I was looking at gaming chairs at first, I saw the ones you mentioned as well, but the secretlab chairs just looked a lot better to me and that's when I decided to reach out to them for a chair. I don't have experience with other gaming chairs so I can't give you insights except that they might use different materials as other chairs look quite...plasticky/cheap. Differences might be in Cushion/foam/PU leather grade, how solid/sturdy the chair is and their brand/warranties. Let me know what you do decide on, I'm interested to know!",Mike Wat,0,2019-01-02 05:55:22+00:00

Almost to positive. The ONLY reason i pulled the trigger is because my cousin has one and absolutely loves it. I took his word for it and here i am disappointed in the butt pad. I was hoping for firm but not rock solid.    Talked to my cousin. Apparently his was really firm and over a few months time it got much better. So we will see,Lucas,0,2019-07-20 04:59:36+00:00

How is the Omega too big for him when he's 5'11 and you're 5'7 and it fits perfect for you. If it's too big for him shouldn't it be MASSIVE for you?,8,Digital Foundry,2018-12-09 00:50:53+00:00,"I see how that could be confusing! The Biggest difference was that his back was longer than mine. There was enough room for his head to rest on the backrest. However, the chair is still WIDE for him. So in that case, he felt it to be a bit big still - not super snug or tight fit for someone who is 5'11.

Again great question, let me know if I can further clarify! :) MW",Mike Wat,1,2018-12-10 02:17:13+00:00

gGQtbDKmd3M,"Have been using my Omega for some time now and I absolutely love it. One thing buyers should beware of is the fact that they will not truly love this chair until it has been broken in. The cold foam will hurt your bottom after a few hours of sitting in it right after you set it up. From personal experience I did not really get full enjoyment from this chair until I had sat in it for about 10-12hrs. That is honestly the only down side, but it's honestly a very big plus because this foam will last you much longer than any other gaming chair out there. The build quality was very impressive down to the screws to hold this chair together. And the lack of noise on tile which I have in my room is perfect! With gaming chairs you definitely get what you pay for and this chair is far better than any DX racer I've owned and they are priced pretty similar with secret lab being a bit more expensive, but the wider back surface area and the less aggressive wings make it feel much better than the formula series DX racers.

Side note on the comfort: I always laughed at the thought of people sleeping in their chairs, but after reclining the chair about five notches back from the max up right position (no where near all the way back) while listening to music, I seriously almost fell asleep in it!

I always tell people go big or go small never in between. Either spend a lot of money on a really nice chair that will lay you a while and help your back. Or just buy a cheap one from Walmart.

I have seen many reviews of the omega and titan chairs and you are the most fun and charming by far! ;) Just a question about the chair, my only concern is that I like to spread my legs sometimes, and I do not know if the lateral ""wings"" bother you.. does it?, and how are the wrinkles going today? I think I prefer the fabric version to avoid this, the new charcoal version it's just awesome! ;)

Hopefully it breaks in more for me. I will say it feels great on my back with the lumbar maxed out. I wish they would have that hard foam on the arms playing on a controller makes my elbows sore.

I've used it for 3 weeks now and I actually like the firmness. I find the firmness to be nice, because if its too soft, it hurts my back, just like a soft bed. I have MAJOR chronic back pain and I'm glad to say that this chair works well for me!

So I got no complaints about it moving out of place. Also, If you're the same size as me, I can tell you that the Omega is just right for you - the titan is HUGE from what I see, like...you need to be 6 foot tall to fill that space up in the chair.

I'm surprised you'd be able to rest comfortably for 5-8 hours on the chair.

6eyQGn5Df4k,"This chair has a counter-ergonomic design flaw. The seat has an incline up by the front edge. Combined with the firmness of the foam it really badly cuts into hamstrings (bottom part of thighs). This is more than uncomfortable and makes thighs sore and numb as it affects blood flow.
I had watched 5 reviews including this one before I ordered. So I knew the foam is firm. This actually suits me well. The size I chose is a good fit fort me too. But even with the chair set in the lowest to the ground and max tilt forward to reduce the thighs pressure as much as possible, it is hard to bear even over a short period of time.
I'm sending it back and am yet to see how much it is going to cost me.  It is really a puzzle how a chair which such an obvious flaw can have so many good reviews and none mentioning this issue. Wouldn't recommend it.",0,tamashumi,2020-09-13 18:06:23+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

6eyQGn5Df4k,I bought this chair based on this review and many others. The 2020 softweave version. It's not a good chair. I will say that overall the seat is firm but comfortable. However the back is firm and uncomfortable. Also the position of the lumbar support is not good and it actually needs a little of thoracic spine support based on its design. The neck pillow is useless because it you use it as recommended it pushes your spine forward to where you can't feel the back support. I didn't have back pain before getting this chair and after using it for 24 hours have new back pain. I ended up sending it back and eating the shipping cost. Very disappointing and sad that it didn't work out and I am exploring other options currently. Customer service was extremely difficult to work with and it took more than a week for them to agree to let me send it back. I was quite frustrated with them. Shipping cost is on the consumer. With UPS it cost 133 dollars to ship the chair back. Buyer beware if you're buying this.,0,Luke Masha,2020-09-06 23:18:16+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan
6eyQGn5Df4k,"I just bought it. It's great! I already feel months of accumulated back pain leaving me!
My only complaint is that the armrests do not seem to be at the exact same distance compared to one another. My right arm can extend the equivalent of one notch further away. Also I was suprised that the armrests angle adjustment has only 3 30¬∞ positions ( \|/ ). I would have hoped for a middle ground between the centered position and the single inner angle. 5 positions would have been perfect. For now I use the standard position as my arm are almost never than angled (maybe only when using a controller?).",1,Guillaume Briand,2020-08-27 21:51:03+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

I then follow back up once again re-re-re confirming cancellation, only to not get a response at all. I then have to resubmit a new inquiry to get them to respond, and again I get more stalling and people saying ‚Äúwe will respond to your cancellation request shortly‚Äù instead of just cancelling it.

Here's my view on the chair.  Packaging is next level and assembly was easy (one person).  Took me 30 min, and I took my time.  It's really well made and it's very eye catching. Stitching and all that are on point.  Gotta say, sitting in the chair....  Shockingly FIRM!  I mean, sitting on those hard stone park benches firm.   But, and I can't explain it, it's comfortable!  No problems or discomfort all day.  It really supports my back (I have my turned all the way down).  I'm no longer leaving forward, with my back not touching the back portion of the chair.  Any way I positioned it, my back was supported.  Never had a chair do this.  What I like most?  The armrest.  Never realized how low the others were.

6eyQGn5Df4k,"The genius of this chair is that it goes against what you think comfort is. I've been plagued by back problems my entire life, compounded by a spinal injury several years ago. Any length of time spent at my desk would result in both back pain and what I call ""chair fatigue"". 
After a month of using it I had NO back pain. None. Not a bit and chair fatigue was non existant. I can sit in that thing for 12 hours plus and I just don't get tired. And this is no fan boying. I've owned so many chairs that I've lost count and they all failed me in some way. But this chair just keeps on giving. 
I love it and my wife loves it. Not only is a delight for her to sit in after a long shift caring for sick and elderly patients but it's genuinely made her a happier person. And I have to admit it made me a happier, more relaxed and less irratible person as well. 
This chair may not give you what you 'think' you want, but it certainly gives you what you need. Gone are the days paying for back treatments, painkillers and any sort of cushion to make a cheaper chair feel comfortable enough to use for prolonged periods. 
Also they are built like tanks. After several months of use the chair looks and feels as good as the day I got it. 
I set up a computer in another room and bought myself a cheaper chair that looked similar. And that was all that was similar. Within days my back was complaining, the arm rests just weren't right and I was napping during the day just to take a rest from sitting. So today I put together a new one and I don't regret a penny I've spent on either of the Titans we now own. Yes it is expensive, but how much am I going to save on back pain treatments? How much sanity will I save now I'm relaxed and my relationship has improved. I know it's crazy to say and probably more crazy to read, but it's the truth. 
Now as to cost. I think of it this way. How long do we spend in bed each day? Now think how much you would spend on your bed.

6eyQGn5Df4k,"""it doesn't have exxagerated bucket-style seats""


That's 100% why I chose the titan over other options. I am pretty short for a Titan (about the minimum requirement) but I have pretty large thighs for my height and weight and most of the bigger gamers options weren't a great fit (the few I did get to sit in seemed designed for people too tall compared to me) but the Titan is perfect in that regard. At minimum height my sitting is great, I have room on the side and don't feel constrained and I finally stopped leaning forward when using my computer which can't be bad for my eyes and spine.


Buying this was a big expense for me and it wasn't perfect (one of the armrest button was broken on delivery, I need to call them for that) but as of now that chair is pretty much everything I expected (I was worried because the amount of good reviews on their own site compred to outside websites had me suspicious).

I've bought my TITAN about 6 months ago, and i think it's not better than average. I wanna point out, that especially the build quality is even worse than average. The lumbar support will damage the ""inside"" material and force a continous ""squeaking noise"" inside of the backrest everytime you lean back. I got a new backrest because of this issue, but the new one has got the same problem. (Of course, since it's because of the bad build quality)


I'd recommend to buy a good chair like the Hermann Miller models or the Steelcase Gesture. If you don't want to spend so much money on a chair, just go with a good one in the 200$ price range. Trust me, Secretlab is all about marketing. I don't know if all these guys recommonding them are sponsored or something but they really don't live up to their hype.

The company said it will hold up but he could tip over while fully reclined if he exceeded the weight limit, so they cant recommend it to someone over the weight restriction .",0,solen18,2019-08-13 06:52:33+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan
6eyQGn5Df4k,"I bought my Titan a few weeks ago in the softweave fabric. I'm 6' 1"" 260lbs and I have to say after a few weeks I'm not impressed with this chair. For one thing, the built in lumbar support is too high, it should be a few inches lower to support your lower back. Even if I sit straight up it's too high on my back. Second problem is the armrests, they are not comfortable at all and I ended up getting armrest pads to soften them. Worst of all though, I sit in this chair a lot since I work from home and I can already feel the foam under my butt starting to compress all the way down to the frame of the chair. It's like the chair has plenty of foam for the thighs but not enough for the butt. For 400+ dollars I was expecting a little better. I'm not shipping this thing back so I'll probably keep it for a while then give it away.",1,wrinkleneckbass,2019-08-11 07:19:57+00:00,"how long have you had it for, im the same height was looking at getting the softweave fabric as well",James Crittle,0,2020-01-04 23:13:25+00:00

6eyQGn5Df4k,"I bought the Maxnomic ErgoReceptor Pro with those exaggerated bolsters in the seat. It also has the cold cured foam that is pretty firm. I ended up returning it in 2 weeks because I thought that was the length of the return policy... I was mistaken it was 30 days with a full refund. I wish I would have ridden out the full 30 days. It was slowly getting more comfortable. I think the issue was the PU leather wasn't giving at all. I say this because I have a new Ram 1500 and I believe it has the same type of foam without the ridiculous bolsters and perforated Napa soft leather  that is extremely comfortable. So much so, that I'm actually contemplating getting one from the salvage yard and retrofitting casters on it and using that as my computer chair.

I have been debating getting the fabric Titan for these reasons but I'm very leery of their return policy with that restocking fee and user paid return shipping. I believe if I had the Maxnomic Ergo Receptor Office it would have been more comfortable because the office series do not have the exaggerated bolsters.

The arm rests I got some memory foam ones from amazon and they are completely legit now (I believe the brand name was called Aloudy, not the ones with straps, they completely fit over the titans arm rests).

My amazon 100$ chair felt better 1. Its way too hard for any comfort. 2. The alignment of the back rest to the seat is off so its slanted in the back. 3. The seat is super deep. I'm 5'11 and sitting all the way back to have a flat foot on the ground I have to put the chair to the lowest. 4. The company is super sketchy if you go on their website it's all 5 star reviews and when you check the 1 star reviews it's all positive comments. So all their reviews are faked. 5. The lumbar and head rest dont help at all. So yea save that money and buy a chair from somewhere else. I usually dont regret purchases but this chair is definitely the biggest regret.,Ryan,6,2020-03-30 21:56:04+00:00

Everything is holding up well and I probably should have opted for the Omega being my frame being a tad smaller. The seat cushion is still hard and I use my own cool gel seat pad at times for more comfort. The back lumbar adjustment is not that good and when I rock I get a clanking sound from the pivot bars underneath. Seems like they put all the effort into the looks and packaging but not so much in comfort. You could easily buy a sub $200 chair that feels the same.

My legs are 18"" high and there's about a half inch gap between the chair and my legs so circulation is fine. If I needed a few more inches though I have a $20 footrest which raises my legs 3"" just in case so it wouldn't be too big of a deal anyways. I'm also 215lb and 6' tall if that helps gauge how the chair might work for you. I generally take good care of my products and don't have any cats that would scratch the PU Leather and as a result the leather is holding up nicely. There's no wear or tear on any of the leather or armrests. This chair was definitely worth the money since I'm sitting the majority of the day.

The sides of the seat cut off circulation a bit though so I've had to buy a cushion foot rest to raise my legs enough to not be uncomfortable. I honestly don't think the chair is worth the money even though it's held up well and hasn't torn anywhere. Small things have started to grate on me like the armrest not going back as far as I'd like or the side of the seat cushion being raised enough to require a footrest. I still think for most people these would be non issues, I'm just picky and want to milk everything from each dollar. Btw, I'll put a link at the end of my comment on the footrest I use if your curious. Hope this was useful.

Im 186Cm, and yes it was the Titan. When i got it home, my first thought was ""Did i really pay so much for a chair?"" But when i got it together, and sat down, i noticed it was harder than my old chair, i thought it was a bit weird. But now, 3 days later, i fucking love this chair. I no longer sit hunched over, i can sit straight, i can almost do a Pewdiepie and use it as a bed. 
And i love the armrests, they  are soft-hard foam, and can be adjusted to the height of the desk.
And the built in lumbar support is so luxurious, you just turn a button to adjust the height of it! So no need for a clumsy pillow.

In my opinion the PU leather is the most logical choice for our kind of climate, hot and humid. The leather will be easier to maintain as compared to the fabric version (which my friend has and I didnt like it).

1ABIJZdhv3s,"Any guitar players in here that have any comments about the arm rests?
I am looking for a chair that is great for office use, great for gaming but also great for the music/mixing/mastering studio. It's good that one can remove the armrests, but having to unbolt them sounds very time consuming. But, a lot of the ones that fold up offer no adjustments (not even height adjustments) and that to me is also problematic for office and gaming usage. I'm also a smaller guy (just below 5' 6"") and I am worried that the seat's depth (front to back) might cut off some circulation in my legs (pressure points right under the knee in the part that bends, sciatic nerve).
I hate to be that guy commenting asking people for the answers, but I've done so much research and checked out so many chairs that I feel a bit lost at this point. I highly doubt someone who already owns this chair who also plays guitar is going to see this but I figured I might as well test the waters and find out.",0,Cole Krasznay,2020-07-16 18:45:58+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

The seat on his is longer than on mine, let alone wider.  The lumbar pillow is very comfortable, maybe 4 inches thick at the thickest part, and compresses to about half that.

If your feet can touch the ground in the Titan at 5'7"" I should have no problems, and the increased room due to less aggressive wings make it sound dreamy!

KuDumLawukw,"This review was great, not as helpful for me but great none the less. I'm 170cm tall and roughly 100kg so Secret Labs recommend the Omega and I think it'd be a great fit but I am worried about the ""gamer poses"" as I do love doing the one foot folded under the leg. Still I think the Titan would be too big and the supports wouldn't work as well so I guess the Omega would be the best choice even if it isn't as comfy. I think it will still be comfortable but I'm unsure. Any suggestions Mike?",2,burns0100,2020-07-06 13:19:57+00:00,"Not Mike, not owned any of them. But i would probably go with the titan.

Since the omega has a Snug fit seat base, and the titan has a leveled seat base, i don't know what to choose between them.

But if you're even an inch shorter, I would suggest the Omega as it will have a more snug fit than a Titan which will be too large for your body curvature to mold properly with the lumbar support and the neck pillow.

But if you already have a healthy back and don't care much about the ergonomics but more for spaciousness, Titan will be a good choice.

KuDumLawukw,"I‚Äôm glad YouTube recommended me this video. Other reviews were helpful in terms of sharing insights of the chairs‚Äô features, functionality, and comfortability. And many reviews also do comparisons between secret lab chairs and other different chairs, and all those reviews are helpful to people are trying to make a decision on which brand of chair to purchase. But for people who have already decided to get the secretlab chair, myself included, it really leaves us with a question mark as to which model of secretlab chair to get. Based on secretlab generic recommendation, I should have gotten the Omega 2020. But based on dimensions, I much preferred the Titan, which was why I preordered the Titan. However, like many people, there‚Äôs always doubts in our purchase decision, especially on expensive luxuries. A common question that didn‚Äôt get answered in many review videos is that, will the Omega or Titan be good fit for my size. Your video did just that, comparing users of different size and height in experiencing comfort of those 2 models, and that experiment alone answered my doubts in my decision of going with the Titan. So I wanted to say thank you so much for making this video, I‚Äôm sure it helped a lot of people in making their decision, and surely it will help many more to come.",1,Konquerian,2020-05-17 18:56:32+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

I wanted to ask, how vertical does the back of the Titan go? I noticed it was more reclined than the Omega in the comparison but not sure whether that's the max, or just how you had it set for a lot of the video.

I much prefer the Titan over the Omega because I have a big butt and really like to cross my legs or have a leg up from time to time. The base is a bit large, but it's not bad, means there's a lot of room. The Omega's wings on the side was problematic for me which made cross legging uncomfortable and that is a deal breaker.

KuDumLawukw,"13:25, I'm your size in terms of height @Mike Wat (5'7 and a half of course lol) but I'm leaning more towards Noah's THICC-ness. I'm so glad I went with the TITAN. I just went with my Gut, both literally and mentally lol, it seemed more spacious to my eyes on-site and based off a few TrustPilot reviews, I heard the ""Bucket-Style"" seating that the Omega chairs had was actually doing a guy around 5'8 or 5'9 a disservice because he hated the snug-fit, he said it was actually hurting his thighs or whatever after awhile. I was like... *You know what? Having more of something is usually better than having less of something and I'm close enough to the 5'9 - 6'7 (TITAN Sizing) mark that I don't think it will be a problem for me if I go for the TITAN. Happy to say I was right in this assessment!* 


Thee only thing I was worried about was whether the neck pillow would be useful to my neck or not and THANK GOODNESS you made this video because now I can see that someone at 5'7 can actually use it very easily @11:30 so WOO! I can't wait for my chair to come on May 20 - 25! (Yes, it's delayed cause of the Corony Viro.)

KuDumLawukw,"If you are taller than 5'7"", don't make the mistake I did. Do NOT get the Omega. The problem pointed out about the chair hitting the back of your shoulders is a HUGE problem. It doesn't just hit the shoulder blades, it hits the back of your tricep right near your ulnar and median nerves that run all the way down through your wrist. The constant pushing on this area will eventually cause your hand and arm to go numb, which you will assume is just carpal tunnel caused at the wrist area.

I'm not sure if you've bought the chair yet, and I'm no chair expert, but I decided to buy the TITAN 2020 all black model. So, the first thing that you would notice is an overpowering smell of off-gassing(a bunch of chemicals) but apparently it's harmless and will take a nearly a week to clear with windows open(my room is about 20x8x8). I believe this is also quite typical of better quality memory foam. Now to answer your question,  if you sit like a gentleman at a fancy restaurant with your legs straight out in front and feet planted, knees at 90,  I have a slight gap. But if you sit like that with your legs apart, there is slightly more of a gap because there are 'no corners' so to speak. Comfort wise, I'd say that the seat is as most has described as ""stiff"" but have gotten used to it and find it quite comfortable. I'd say the overall quality is quite solid and the neck rest comes in really handy. Even tried having a quick snooze a couple times with the chair reclined, not too shabby.

The chair still fits good. I use it daily for work plus gaming so I‚Äôm in a a minimum of 8 hours a day, less on the weekend. And yes there‚Äôs about 1.5-2 inches from the back of the knee when I sit all the way back.

can you tell me if there is a diffence between the 2 chairs about the base seat tilt angle  ?  Between the front and the back of the base  ?  I have the titan and the front of the seat is so high related to the back that it make a compression under my knees.

There should be a 3 finger or one fist clearance between them.  See https://www.hrce.ca/sites/default/files/hrsb/Downloads/pdf/HR/OH&S/Ergonomics%20Checklist.pdf.

I think the titan is very spacious and is built for someone closer to 6‚Äô. Softweave is better long-term, but is not as resistant to stains. The PU leather will ‚Äúcrack‚Äù after a while(probably 2-4 years of use, depending on how you treat it). 
I would personally pick the omega over the titan. But you should consider depending on if you‚Äôre going to grow much taller(hard to estimate) and your sitting positions(as the titan has a wider seat).

I'm still a bit in doubt, because I'm 170 as well, but i really like to sit with my legs crossed (kind of a lotus position/John gaming position n¬∫1), so I don't know if the Omega will have enough room to do that comfortably. On the other hand I fear that the Titan wont be as fitting in the neck and shoulder areas. Probably the Omega would help me sit in a healthier position tho xD.

nBnCOKf2V7g,"Some insight into PU leather. All PU Leather eventually peals. Its the nature of the material. I have had three PU Leather chairs, from three different manufacturers (Not secret lab), and all have inevitably started pealing. The average time til the pealing starts is about three years. After the third chair I swore off PU Leather forever and decided to go fabric. The fact that your chair started pealing after two years is not a good sign. This is most likely due to the sweating and hot/humid environment. Both of which can expedite the pealing process. I'm sorry to say that its going to get worst over time. Just for some context, my first desk chair that i ever bought (i currently use as a back up chair), which is fabric, looks as good today as the day i bought it. That chair is 27 years old. To replace my last PU Leather chair, I also went with the Secret lab titan, but went with the soft weave. Awesome chair. When you replace your chair, and i'm sorry to say that you will be replacing it, go with the soft weave. Its comfortable , its breathable and you won't be replacing it in three years.

Just to give you an idea, the Titan chairs go for ¬£400 from secret lab's UK website, which is the same as $509 dollars at the current exchange rate. Also consider that the current exchange rate favours the dollar more than it has for decades, so normally this chair will be even more expensive for UK customers. At one point in the late naughties, ¬£400 would have been the same as roughly $700.

The same is true for many games consoles and has been for a while. The PS5 is going to screw us over once again, but this behavior seems to have become normalized to the point that no one says anything about it. Like you said, this is common with products that are sold worldwide, and it does frustrate me when companies continue to mug us off like this. I wouldn't be surprised if Australia has it even worse.

I had watched 5 reviews including this one before I ordered. So I knew the foam is firm. This actually suits me well. The size I chose is a good fit fort me too. But even with the chair set in the lowest to the ground and max tilt forward to reduce the thighs pressure as much as possible, it is hard to bear even over a short period of time.

That's ergonomic to reduce hamstring pressure. Some chairs have the edge flat. These are usually cheap with not much thought about ergonomic put in their design. Titan has a pressure increasing incline at the edge. This may be irrelevant in a car from which gaming chairs derive their look. But in a car seat it so low to the floor that knees go high and thighs don't even touch the seat front edge usually anyway. This kind of an edge incline makes a desk chair counter-ergonomic. Even if some sitters don't notice, the pressure is there.
You've got it right. It's frustrating. Even more so as I wasted most of the Sunday trying to disassemble the chair without a full success.

Anyway, I'm glad the chair suits you. Sorry for the rant under your review and thanks. I hope the next chair will please my bum better too.",tamashumi,0,2020-09-13 19:25:12+00:00

nBnCOKf2V7g,"I've very happy with my Titan SoftWeave Fabric chair. It arrived last month, and have been using it daily for work at home, and gaming at night. It's a very heavy chair. It also feels super sturdy. It's surprisingly stiff. I went with the Softweave for a couple of reasons. First, my last 3 chairs were made with that fake leather material. It feels and looks nice at first. But that lasts only a few years. But it will eventually peel in these tiny fragments. Second, my cats liked clawing and peeling off the fake leather fragments in tiny bits at a time. Think of it like a thick vinyl coating, that when you peel off you have this intact naked cushion. You can still sit on it, but it looks terrible.  So far my cats don't seem to be that interested in this Softweave chair. They act the same towards our fabric couch in the living room. 
It took me about 20 minutes to assemble the chair myself. All the tools you need are included. Although I had a minor issue that the left side of the chair does not look like the left side pictured in the 1 page instuctions, nor the video. ""Why does it look different? Is it missing a bracket?"", were my initial thoughts. I emailed their tech support, with pictures and got a response within 12 hours that all was normal. They just need to update their video and 1 page to show the correct left side of the chair. I guess that part of the design got updated recently.

That said, I'm still super happy with this purchase. My 2 gripes are; 1 it is expensive. And, 2 the logo and lettering on the chair is a bit tacky. But you get what you pay for. And I can live with the logo and lettering. Glad to hear your chair is still holding up after 2 years.",0,Volt Ron,2020-07-12 04:17:43+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

nBnCOKf2V7g,"Yo, I also had this chair for 2 years. I got the all black PU version back in sept 2018. My room is always dark and usually cool. I don't really sweat much even on this chair. My leather has held up rather nicely over the years, only a few wrinkles here and there. I saw some peeling on this guy's chair, and knew what happened when he said that room didn't have AC. Don't get pu leather if your going to sit in such an environment as this was also a problem in a lot of south east asia places. I just triple checked my chair, there is no tearing leather like yours, and a good chunk of my free time is spent on this chair.

My one complaint would be the older model's armrests being wobbly af from the plastic parts over time, but it seems as if they fixed that in the 2020 series. Another small complaint was that my bony butt felt slightly uncomfortable at the way back of the chair due to less foam on that side, and I offset this with some back pillows. That really is more of the nit picky things though, overall I'd say it does justify the $399 price, however, it's not packing any further value. If this was $499 i'd say not worth but it's priced pretty good for what the overall experience has been for me. No pains from sitting so much over the years unlike my previous el cheapo chair (couldn't sit longer than 30 min before pain).",0,treymtz,2020-07-10 20:24:08+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

Not a fan of the fabric? But then complains about PU. Then what material do you want? They have leather too. 
Ergo chair is ugly. May be a comfortable chair not sure. But mesh chairs aren't really that good. Herman millers are outrageous for what they are. Most gaming chairs suck. Its better to go with a really nice standard office chair.

Edit: I've had better luck with standard office chairs more than anything. Only problem with most of those is the legs usually break. Because they're plastic. But other than that they're comfortable if you can find a good one.",Heaven,0,2020-07-08 03:00:51+00:00

I actually really like the head pillow, it's very comfortable and being able to move it around helps a lot. I kind of wish the Titan came with a lumbar pillow. I couldn't get the adjustable lumbar support to work well for me so I'm using a pillow.

nBnCOKf2V7g,"Before I got a gaming chair my set up was my bed, a wall, and a pillow for back support. And if I got lucky I got to use a lawn chair. I always felt uncomfortable and I was constantly adjusting the pillow cause it was compressing under me but it worked. Luckily for me my dad saw this and felt bad that I sitting up against the wall(I know, first world problems) and got me a chair, now this was the only gift I got from since this chair was over a $250 dollars last I checked. The rest of birthday was my mom and grandpa giving a hundred dollars each nothing else. The chair is a respawn 110 model, it‚Äôs a really awesome and comfortable chair that I use every time I sit to play games. The leather is really nice and yes it can do that thing(pewd fans will know) the back support is immensely great and the neck/headrest is great. The leg rest is very convenient and I didn't even know I wanted one. Overall, it doesn't do anything to improve your gameplay but it's definitely better than a office or lawn chair.",0,The Doctor,2020-06-15 03:59:16+00:00,Cool blog.,JohnBurgundy66,0,2020-06-29 06:02:35+00:00

nBnCOKf2V7g,"Awesome video! Discovered you after badseedtech recommended you! Thanks for the review on the Titan chair, I've actually had this for about 2 months now (the all-black version you wanted!) and agree with all your points, however I'm a bit on the shorter side and recently learned about footrests to help with comfort. The Titan is really comfy for me except for that fact that my feet don't completely touch the floor and I don't get to benefit fully from the chair.

Thank you!",4,blitzio,2020-05-26 04:10:34+00:00,"I do plan on making an ergonomics video and in that video I'll cover foot rests, but until then I can give you some quick basic info on this subject. You want your chair to be high enough in relation to your desk  so that your arms rest at a comfortable position as opposed to shrugged up and tight. When you use your keyboard, it should be as if its sitting in your lap. When your seat is high enough to do this, your feet may not touch the ground so a foot rest can help with this. It allows your feet some support and you can usually move them up and down to maintain some circulation. Does this kind of answer your question?",Fracno,2,2020-05-27 06:53:01+00:00

If you're looking for something that'll keep your back straight and upright, the ErgoChair won't do it. The lumbar support is really nice, but there is no upper back support. I found it worked better with a desk that had a keyboard tray, but I don't regularly use one, so it definitely wasn't for me. The angle it forced me to look at when leaning back in it was too high vs. where my monitor was. Just some fair warning - they have 30 and 15 day trials in the US and Canada respectively.

Gtc4ygj2l_A,"I've been using a Secret Lab Omega (stealth) since early 2017, so over 3 years now. And I have to say, I'm looking to upgrade to an actual ergonomic chair. The foam on the seat definitely does not soften up over time, it's as firm now as it was day\week 1 (I'm ~185lbs). The leg fatigue is very real. The only way I survive in this thing 10+ hours a day (been WFH since 2016), is with the lumbar pillow & head pillow, plus I had to add a memory foam foot rest a couple years ago. The build quality is definitely solid, it's survived multiple moves w\o any tearing, fading, or any degradation of quality at all. However, if you want an actually comfortable chair, I'd steer as far away from a ""gaming"" chair as possible.

* PVC leather imitation started to peel off in few years. 
* You can see that the back rest is straight, it will not support your back well. 
* The seat cushioning will lose firmness and in short time you can feel the frame construction seen in 4:13. 
* The hand rests are rattling like hell.
These gaming chair companies are heavily investing in marketing and looks. For most of the buyers the 300$+ price tag is a big expense so they are likely to defend their purchase. In reality, you are better off with a random office chair that suits you and that you can try in the store and which costs 1/2 the price .",0,deafno,2020-05-31 12:08:16+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

The backseat bracket are mounted on top of the seat, so when you decline all the back, the bottom of the backseat are giving a hump in your back!

Hate the marketing ""4 TrUz G@m3rz"" around it, but I wanted a good chair, and it is. Assembling is very easy (except the part when you have to attach the back and the base, don't tighten fully until you have the 4 screws in) and well explained.


It rolls pretty easily, lumbar support pillow is very good (but don't attach to the chair unfortunately), seat is firm (maybe too much for some, test it before if you can), but not too firm, please scare your guest with the rocking/160¬∞ tilt features, DON'T HAVE SEX ON IT, you will probably break it and will roll all the way to your mama's house before you know it.

Gtc4ygj2l_A,"The SecretLab chairs have good quality materials, and the stitching is top notched. You hear this in all online reviews.


What you do not normally hear, are experiences from a non-youtuber using it for more than 6 months. The chair is firm, too firm, if you will, and does not soften over time. So sitting on it for more than an hour will get your butt hurt literally. I find myself shifting side to side in discomfort, as the seat is too hard. I ended up softening the seat with an additional cloth cushion so I get more hours on the chair. I hear this reviewer mentioning this issue too. A cushion will help.


The lumbar support is fine, but the support and height are not for everyone. For shorter users, it supports them at the right part of their back. For me, at about 179cm height, it seems to support the top of my hips more then the arc on my back. I stopped using it. So do be careful if you are near or above the recommended height.


The arm rests will loosen over time, and start to move about. Not a big issue, though I would thought the mechanism will hold out longer.


I have not tried other gaming chairs before, so I do not know if the above issues relate particularly to gaming chairs but to me, the purchase and price point are not worth it. I can easily circle through a few cheaper, more comfortable chairs with the money and with money left over.

Gtc4ygj2l_A,"I've had a SecretLab Titan for a few months now and it's great. As this review says, it is a little firm. It's not the most relaxing thing to sit in, but it is supportive, particularly when you're at your desk for long periods. The Titan looks basically the same as the Omega, but it's a little bigger and therefore designed for taller and/or heavier people.

Two minus points for me: first, the height-adjustable arms could do with some sort of fixed points so that you can easily set them both at the same height without guessing or (yes, I've done this) measuring! Second point was that my chair wasn't level after assembly. I ended up unscrewing the ""lower"" side of the base and putting some rubber washers in as spacers to level it up. You shouldn't have to do this on a premium chair, though.

Those points aside, I've found this to be a nice balance between cheaper ""ergonomic"" chairs and the much higher-price options from the likes of Herman Miller. Definitely good value!",1,Ben Adamson,2019-12-20 13:15:33+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

Gtc4ygj2l_A,"I'm a not happy owner of one of these god awful chairs, just got my stark chair a little over a week ago and it's a beautiful work of art. But as a chair it's about as comfortable as bleachers at a high school game. The chair is rock hard it sits a mile high even at the lowest setting and if you wear glasses like I do, you will be looking under your lenses. If your under 5 foot 7 like I am this chair is not for you even though they say it's for 5 foot 3 and up. They will not help me with customers service, no one to talk to. Just computer generated emails that tell me the same thing over and over and recommend the titan chair to me now. I have never felt so taken for my money in my life.

The embody is probably better posture-wise (though the Secret Labs lumber pillow is very good).

When I worked in a office furniture factory. In Australia the standard are higher. And if my SL titan was made at my old work it would be remade. You could sell it. As it's dodgy.

The lumbar support gives me garbage posture so I just don't use it; it was aggravating my anterior pelvic tilt.

Also, creases and even small wrinkles where the stitching meets for each sheet of leather they used to get their shape, on mine mostly on the backrest where stitching meets. If you have never had a secretlab before, you might get this and think nice chair, but it's nothing compared to the 2018 model.

Im so impatient,1,-HonoR- LN,2019-10-15 17:02:46+00:00,- BiOHZRD - They use a cold cured foam which is high quality and maintains its shape no matter how long or often you sit in it (Most conventional chairs use cheap crappy foam) So as for comfort the cheaper conventional foam will be comfier at first but after 10 minutes will flatten out and have you sitting on a board/base of the chair giving no padding or comfort at all. So although Secretlab chairs might not be as ‚ÄúSoft‚Äù the quality standpoint is wayyyy higher and will last a lot longer giving you more comfort than other chairs.

My feet can just rest on the ground when I'm in the lowest setting which is great (though this might vary due to individual differences in lower leg length).
Sitting cross-legged is nice too, if you raise the two armrests to an appropriate height.
I find that with the ikea cushion, it puts you out of position from the lumbar support, which was fine, because the Softweave seat is relatively soft, and reports from users have shown it getting softer over time. Heard the PU leather version has a harder seat.",Jake C,0,2020-05-26 20:07:58+00:00

They totally employ shady review/marketing tactics for sure.  


I've got one now, it's a decent chair for sure, especially compared to my old one. I will say that they offer a 5 year warranty in exchange for a social media post with a picture, which I put on twitter that I hadn't used in years, and haven't used since. They even followed up asking for additional photos so they could use them on their own platforms and they'd credit me. I declined to follow up with them about it because I'm not a) hard up for attention b) I paid them good money for the chair, if they want me to produce marketing material for them they can pay me. 


As far as office chairs go, I'm sold. You can easily spend 1k+ on a herman miller (I've got one at work and it just seems like a chair to me) or you can spend 90 at office max for a piece of junk - which I've done on multiple occasions. For ~$300 this chair is comfortable, super adjustable, and looks nice. It seems like it should last a while. Overall I'm pretty happy with it.",CAFE Gaming,1,2020-01-23 00:33:43+00:00

v8sgvci6gR0,"Just my comment on this chair -- got it a month ago after watching this review. The thing to remember is that chairs are pretty unique to people I think, because for me it's extremely uncomfortable; in particular, because the seating is very firm and the outer edge is raised, it pushes up against my knees/lower thigh and blocks blood flow to my lower legs which causes pain after a while and I suspect is actually really unhealthy. Now I guess i can't fault Secret Lab for not making a perfectly universal chair, but the thing to keep in mind here is that unlike buying from a store I have no options to return this chair.

Build quality was fantastic, better than any I've seen, and their fake leather was really high quality too. Just the poor ergonomics (flat back rest) make the chair really uncomfortable for every day use and gave me back pain. The Titan had correct back ergonomics, but the front edge of the seat killed my blood flow to my knees because of how they shaped it. I ended up switching to the Autonomous Kinn chair.

For one thing, the built in lumbar support is too high, it should be a few inches lower to support your lower back. Even if I sit straight up it's too high on my back. Second problem is the armrests, they are not comfortable at all and I ended up getting armrest pads to soften them. Worst of all though, I sit in this chair a lot since I work from home and I can already feel the foam under my butt starting to compress all the way down to the frame of the chair. It's like the chair has plenty of foam for the thighs but not enough for the butt. For 400+ dollars I was expecting a little better.

Ive had a lot of gaming chairs and this is by far the best one ive ever owned and recommend it fully to anyone looking to invest into it. Another thing is the foam they use in Secretlab chairs is a material (Cold cured foam) thats built to last and not break down over time, most chairs on the market use the typical plain old foam that ends up breaking down and disintegrating into dust leaving you with a sad excuse of a chair.

When I follow up, they say they were waiting to get confirmation first from me, and send a screen shot of their previous email as proof that they asked me to confirm first, despite the fact I already said and confirmed the cancellation, and still asks me to confirm before processing...again. I then follow back up once again re-re-re confirming cancellation, only to not get a response at all. I then have to resubmit a new inquiry to get them to respond, and again I get more stalling and people saying ‚Äúwe will respond to your cancellation request shortly‚Äù instead of just cancelling it. Its starting to get ridiculous, the worst part is that they drive urgency for you to make a purchase because you need to place your order within a certain time frame since they do shipments in waves, so i will most likely miss the next wave, just because their customer service wants to troll you and talk in circles.

The lumbar support pillow is about a 3.0 it melts to nothing its so soft. I like a chair with good support but would like a little soft in it.

It's just like a mattress, some people find firm mattresses to be atrocious, some find them to be the best thing on the planet.

I'd say the main thing to consider is the seat. Chairs at this price and quality are not going to have the softest seat ever. We know that super soft seats and beds tend to be very bad for posture and back. Unfortunately, the majority of people assume higher quality = softer, so when they receive the chair, they get a firmer seat and think it's really uncomfortable or cheap. 

For some, this chair may be truly uncomfortable, but for most, I think it's the best you can buy. It does have an adjustment period, but after probably a bit of use, you will never go back to another chair.",Marc Maalouli,0,2019-11-23 11:54:02+00:00

Here‚Äôs a quick review for mine. I have the secretlab OMEGA. I love it. I will sat in it almost everyday for the last 6 months and I have only run into one issue. When reclining, the locking mechanism is broken so it will keep reclining to a certain point. After spending hours of googling, I haven‚Äôt found anyone else with this issue so if you see this, I wouldn‚Äôt be too concerned. Lastly, the customer support isn‚Äôt the best I‚Äôve seen.

Comfort 4/5 
a bit more firm that expected, but still great for longer sessions (8-12hrs)

Durability 3/5 
(very durable, mine just broke so I put this any higher, otherwise it would be 5/5)

Functionality 5/5

Customer support 4/5

Price 4/5 a bit pricey but worth it.

Overall 3.6/5

Because I know it was way hot last year, and sweat and all.  But they don't have any color designs to pick from in the material.  I think there was black, grey, and some pink bunny.  Seems like it wouldn't be difficult to make the basic design I finally decided to get my leather in.  It seems they could make that design (amber) into material no problem.  It is mostly black, with a couple amber highlights down the sides.  Or that same design with white highlights is (classic?)  Oh, well.

Basic stuff, no hate tho, do what you have to do. 
Also, all those gaming chairs are overpriced shitty chair. If you want a trully confortable chair that last over time, that are trully ergonomic you need to go to brand like steel case, or any brand that does office chairs.
Every single thing that is branded ""gaming"" is by definition a marketing product that will use the ""gaming feature"" as the main selling point.

BqIse8WLS74,"You guys blasting hate in the comments are clearly just pissed for personal reasons which have got nothing to do with this review.

Sure, the guy is 175cm and barely meets the recommended size for the titan, but being a gaming/tech reviewer he probably has already tried several omegas/thrones to prefer the titan instead. He BOUGHT these chairs for his own use, they were not sent to him specifically for a review. That fact by itself is enough to justify him to judge these chairs however he wishes.
Personally I have own 2 secret lab Omegas (I'm 175cm), and I feel that the cons he mentioned in this review about Secret Lab chairs are very accurate. The neck pillow is way too large and awkwardly placed to my liking, and the quality control is not on par with the price you're paying.

This was an honest and straightforward review, and I don't see any reason for his judgements to be dismissed. If anything you guys are just pissed that he can afford to buy these chairs and complain about their downsides",0,Syafiq Norkhalim,2020-04-26 14:36:40+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

I agree that DX makes good products but this is an unfair judgement for both chairs and if they aren‚Äôt comfortable in the appropriate size for your frame you probably should look into  another chair manufacturer.",10,Taylor,2018-04-14 23:30:20+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

BqIse8WLS74,"The Secret Lab Omega Elite 2018. Is by far the best chair I've ever used hands down!! Outside maybe the Steelcase office chair. 

Which are twice as much but not nearly as comfortable for long excursions. The Titan is not in the same league here.  As the Omega Elite series however. 

But I can understand why most people haven't tried it out considering it's quite spendy.  Furthermore I agree with others though.  

You need to get chairs that fit your size, weight & frame. The E-Blue Corbra, Cougar Armor & some VetraGear chairs I find good for smaller builds. 

The DXRacer series are designed for smaller frames typically as well. 

So it's not a surprise it might fit others a bit better who find the Secret Lab to large. DXRacers are way to tight personally for me.

 I also don't feel there anywhere as comfortable as the Secret Lab or some AK Racing chairs.

However you're not going to find a better built more comfortable chair for larger users almost anywhere. Then the Secret Lab Omega Elite series from SL.

They are clearly the best gaming PC chairs on the market this year for big & tall users. For it's $700 price tag might be a bit much. 

But the Omega 2018 you can get into around $500. Not bad considering everything that you get here. :b",0,BlazinNSoul,2018-03-08 16:22:49+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

Is it soft enough to sit on comfortably for long periods without problems? That's my main concern since I can't judge if it's soft enough without trying it and I don't know anyone who owns one I could try...

I'm also a little worried about the seat depth. It's 54cm according to the Secretlabs website. It looks like your legs (of the 175cm tall guy that is) are juuust about long enough to avoid problems with the seat cushion being too deep for them. I'm 180cm tall. Do you think I'd be OK? Probably depends on whether it's the length from the very back of the cushion to the front of the cushion, or the length of the part you can actually sit on, not counting the bit that's underneath the back rest.

Any advice? Thanks.",DGneoseeker1,0,2018-03-11 20:02:15+00:00

So yeah, and it's mostly the pillows that are not as adjustable as DXRacers. Probably sounding biased because personally we do like the DXRacer way more eventhough we tried really hard to like Secretlabs, but the extra comfort of adjustability and design choices just favor DXRacer for now.",Primeval Media,0,2017-11-27 13:47:51+00:00

FJ20JBOMOws,"At first I also jumped on the guy for being nit-picky. But I just received my XL and I have the same problem as him. One leg of the base is beat to hell, with deep gouges in the powder coating, that left a razor sharp edge right where you rest your foot when sitting on the chair. In his video it doesn‚Äôt seem like a big deal, when it‚Äôs not your chair, but after paying $500 and waiting two months you don‚Äôt expect such a large defect, and he‚Äôs right for being upset over it. Particularly because they made him pay for shipping.

Now I‚Äôm having to go through the exchange process, we‚Äôll see how it goes. But no way am I paying for any shipping or additional parts. Either they back their product and make it right, or I‚Äôm doing a charge back for defective product. I expect them to ship me a new base, with a return label for the old base, that would be the right way to handle this...let‚Äôs see what happens.",1,BiG BeAR,2020-05-19 16:54:30+00:00,"What? Where did you hear that a chargeback is ‚Äúillegal‚Äù? It‚Äôs part of everyday life, if you‚Äôre not satisfied with a product or service, and the company won‚Äôt handle the situation correctly to make it right you have the right to file a chargeback. 

I‚Äôm not even talking about all the fraudulent chargebacks that happen on a regular basis to scam sellers out of products. The credit card companies are way more on the side of the buyer than the seller. 

You can chargeback really at any point after the transaction, it especially helps if you have records of communications with the seller regarding any issues you had, as proof that they‚Äôre not handling the situation correctly. In my previous comment I stated that I‚Äôve reached out to them to give them a chance to handle the situation, and only IF they Don‚Äôt do the right thing would I consider filing a chargeback. Now technically I could‚Äôve just don‚Äôt one right away for a defective product, but I don‚Äôt like not giving them an opportunity to fix the problem first.

Since my last comment they have gotten back to me and sent me two replacement bases. The first one arrived damaged again, with the box damaged and one of the legs of the base poking a hole in the box and sticking out of the box, because of that it was damaged to hell. So they sent me a second base, which finally arrived in one piece with no damage. But since I haven‚Äôt put the chair together until I received the second replacement base, after which I also noticed that the armrests are not even when looking straight at the chair. One armrest is slightly further out then the other, even though when looking underneath the seat they are both attached the same way on their adjuster sliders. So technically a second defect, that I haven‚Äôt decided what to do with yet. I need to figure out if the difference in position is a difference in actual armrest base lengths or are the screw holes under the chair seat just offset incorrectly. So I will be doing some measuring to figure it out, and will report back.",BiG BeAR,0,2020-06-28 04:51:03+00:00

Looks like you ended up with a defect chair that probably had to be removed from the production line but instead arrived at your doorstep.
To me, this sounds more like an intern mistake at the facility where they produce the product, theres always that kind of rotten people in every production line where they sabotage the product for grudges over something stupid in their miserable lives.
People like you need to pay the price for those shamefull decisions.
Id fill in a complaint tho, and id keep pressing untill i get the service done.
Take pictures over and over, keep sending them, i truly believe you would get replacement parts tho.
If you want, send some of the pictures to my email please, i will send them over to the support team aswell for ya.
Already mentionned your youtube vid to the support on fb where they reply pretty frequently.
Send me your fb account link aswell to my email.
So we can properly make contact.
Already made new contact now with them about this issue mentionning ill be waiting with my purchase of 2 titans (for me and the wife) untill you get proper help man.

BTW, be sure you maintain regular medical attention on the cervical disk problem. About 20 years ago I began noticing a bit of numbness in my fingertips. An MRI showed major disk degeneration between my C4 & C5 vertebra. Eventually had surgery on it. That helped until 2 years ago, when I suddenly lost much of the feeling in both hands. This time it was the C6-C7 disk degeneration with major compression of the nerves that fed to my hands. Had a second major surgery on the spine, but there was enough permanent damage to the nerves that my right hand still has a lot of numbness and I can no longer touch type. Just wanted to pass on to stay on top of it and get to specialist immediately if you begin having tingling or numbness in hands & arms, trouble holding on to objects and frequently losing your grip on them, you can't hold a pen or pencil, etc. You want to catch it before permanent damage can set in.",4,John Bales,2020-08-08 19:24:52+00:00,THANK YOU very much for commenting and sharing your experience.

There's really small details here and there that make the difference. Like right now i'm typing this up and my elbows & arms on on the arm rests and they are comfortable.

Otfl8rzba8I,Do you think it's worth the money to buy if you already have an okay gaming chair? Cause I've been thinking about getting one but I don't know if it will be worth it,5,Kyruto,2020-02-28 00:48:44+00:00,"I'm leaning towards no. When you say ""okay"" gaming chair, is there something lacking? like is it not comfortable or what's the deal? if it's doing the job, i would stick with it personally. My previous chair WOULD NOT hold me up. At first, I'd have to adjust the height back up daily but then it got worse and i'd have to adjust it multiple times a day. Besides that, it was worn out. I love the Secretlab chair. I think it was obviously a little expensive but it was a good investment because i do spend a lot of time gaming and on my computer for other productivity stuff.

Which I don‚Äôt see as a posture issue. 
I‚Äôd say as a plan B if you‚Äôd want support & the lumbar support isn‚Äôt helping, you just order an Omega lumbar pillow & use that instead. The lumbar can be adjusted on the seat to go into the chair so you don‚Äôt feel it. Hope this helps! Best of luck with your decision!

What a waste of money :(",Boop Boop,1,2020-08-07 14:34:05+00:00
lRL691QA_vI,"The genius of this chair is that it goes against what you think comfort is. I've been plagued by back problems my entire life, compounded by a spinal injury several years ago. Any length of time spent at my desk would result in both back pain and what I call ""chair fatigue"". 
After a month of using it I had NO back pain. None. Not a bit and chair fatigue was non existant. I can sit in that thing for 12 hours plus and I just don't get tired. And this is no fan boying. I've owned so many chairs that I've lost count and they all failed me in some way. But this chair just keeps on giving. 
I love it and my wife loves it. Not only is a delight for her to sit in after a long shift caring for sick and elderly patients but it's genuinely made her a happier person. And I have to admit it made me a happier, more relaxed and less irratible person as well. 
This chair may not give you what you 'think' you want, but it certainly gives you what you need. Gone are the days paying for back treatments, painkillers and any sort of cushion to make a cheaper chair feel comfortable enough to use for prolonged periods. 
Also they are built like tanks. After several months of use the chair looks and feels as good as the day I got it. 
I set up a computer in another room and bought myself a cheaper chair that looked similar. And that was all that was similar. Within days my back was complaining, the arm rests just weren't right and I was napping during the day just to take a rest from sitting. So today I put together a new one and I don't regret a penny I've spent on either of the Titans we now own. Yes it is expensive, but how much am I going to save on back pain treatments? How much sanity will I save now I'm relaxed and my relationship has improved. I know it's crazy to say and probably more crazy to read, but it's the truth. 
Now as to cost. I think of it this way. How long do we spend in bed each day? Now think how much you would spend on your bed. Now take into account that sitting is one of the worst things to do to your back and, for me, the calculation is simple. My back deserves this chair. And if you are invested in your own back lasting the duration of your life then maybe, just maybe you deserve it too.",6,Mr Thornton,2020-03-31 17:44:10+00:00,"Mr Thornton thank you very much for the amazing input! I‚Äôm very happy to hear your feelings on the chair and couldn‚Äôt agree more with you on the quality of it. It‚Äôs def a chair that‚Äôs built for needs. 
Hope it continues to serve you & your wife many more years of comfort & reliability!

The material Secret Labs uses is called a cold cure foam. Its very firm so that it can hold its shape over long periods of time. Im still  using the same Titan chair from this video, my chair is going on 3 years old, I still love it very much, and feel comfortable in it even after all these years. 
Some desk/gaming chairs use very cushion like seats where over long periods of time they wear down the cushion & you're sitting on compact cushion that feels like you're sitting on the metal/plastic plate of the seat under the cushion. 
Its firm but comfortable. I'd say check over more YT or try and fine other streamers on Twitch to talk w/ about it.
I've had probably 5 people who have purchased through me who followed me on Twitch who are also streamers who have given me great feedback of they love it. (Darkman, Birbasuarus, Faded Sevens are some of them)
Hope this helped",Crue Steele,0,2020-03-25 19:42:41+00:00

lRL691QA_vI,"Their customer service is a joke. Their ""fulfilment partners"" lost the parcel, then they were looking for it for 2 weeks. Finally got the chair going from a warehouse 250 km away with 3 weeks of delay. After my request, they proposed a leather cleaner ""worth"" of 39 EUR or a discount of 25 EUR. Mine is a Napa leather version allegedly worth of 999 EUR... And the quality is far from what I would expect. Apart from the surprising fact that only parts which have contact with the body are made of Napa leather, the rest is not even an ordinary leather - it's PVC/PU.

lRL691QA_vI,"Don't know if you're still active on YouTube or not but let me give you some advice on HeadSets.
Look into the Phillips SHP9500 Headphones and grab a V-Moda Boom Pro Mice if you just have to have one. With your sound setup now, which sounds damned good by the way, I don't think you need the Mic but if you just want one on your head it's a very nice Mic. The SHPs are Open Back but trust me unless you crank the volume far above anything comfortable, I'm an old dude who grew up on Metal and Hair Bands so trust me I know Loud and Comfortable, you want get any Mic Bleed from the Headphones. Look into them they've gotten rave reviews for years from the Audiophile Community, the ones that aren't snobs and are hands down the best headphones you can get sub $100 US. Right now NewEgg has them for $69.99 shipped. There are the SHP9500 and the SHP9500s don't worry both are just as good but I prefer the SHP9500 the original version. Both can be driven by most phones/devices but really, really come alive with a decent DAC/AMP. Outstanding Headphones as far as Sound Stage/Positioning/Sound Quality. Not the super Tinny High End but more than enough to hear every footstep and know exactly where it's coming from. Realize this is a year late but hopefully you still see and look into the SHP hands down best Headphones other than the PC37X or the HD580X Jubilee from Seinhieser that I've ever used and honestly it's a toss up between the 3 with the 37X at $120 or so and the HD580X at $150 on Drop, (used to be MassDrop).

lRL691QA_vI,"Brilliant!  An honest and intelligent review where you remind us that the chair is only part of the posture equation.  LOL, ""bony ass"", that's me!  I'm 5'11"" 150lbs and not much meat down there so every office chair I've had I needed to add fluffy pillows otherwise the chair cushion would cut blood flow after an hour or two.  Now looking at serious gaming chairs to see if that could be a solution.  The ones I've tried like DXRacer in store appear to have some kind of foam that might suit me.  But 5 mins in store is not like sitting in it 4+ hours.  You think the Titan seat would be good for ""bony ass"" constitution?  Lumbar support is important for me so it would be more Titan than Omega it seems.  Small nitpick: When you talk about prices in your videos, try to mention if it's US or Canadian or whatever dollars.  Thanks for a great job on the review!

lRL691QA_vI,"Titan PU Leather is the best among them, sure is pricey, but worth it not only in the long run but also less regret.

Pros: 
Water resistance, 
Easy to clean/wipe over with water, 
Built-in adjustable lumbar support, 
Worth the money in the long run, if looking after properly, 
Warning: Might sleep often in the chair as a backup bed, 
Perfect in wintertime or air-con room temperature.

Cons: 
Too pricey, 
Hopefully will not crack over a period of time, depending on the weather you lived in and the room temperature combining with body temperature, 
It might damage if by accident scratch over a sharp object, 
Get warm faster in the summertime, especially the bump (better get a breathable cushion [fabric] for this as separately to breath, easily without waiting too long to cool down) or use air-con in the room.

Get warm faster in the summertime, especially the bump (better get a breathable cushion [fabric] for this as separately to breath, easily without waiting too long to cool down) or use air-con in the room.

I'm sure it has softened up a bit though and to be honest I've gotten used to it anyway. I still get a slightly sore back every once in a while if I sit weird and touch on a spot in the lumbar support I'm not used to. 

Overall I'm still happy with the chair though. I love being able to just unlock and drop it back into basically a recliner and watch TV, etc. The build quality still seems great, no issues at all.",Craig Cooper,2,2019-05-29 17:29:16+00:00

Now that you had it a bit over a month, did the foam ""break in"" or is it still stiff?
I've heard people say they though the sitting area was too hard, especially in the middle. Do you also think that, or do you think it's pretty comfortable despite the stiffness?

Can't wait to try it out :D",4,Craig Cooper,2019-04-21 13:52:36+00:00,"@Cosmic Smeck I've had it for ~2 days now, so I'll give you my first thoughts. For height wise, it fits fine. My head reaches just to the top of the chair, but the pillow is right in my neck, which feels nice. Width wise, I can feel the lower side bolster things touching my sides, but it doesn't feel tight, or squeezing, just sort of feel support there. The arm rests have lots of movement so I've been able to find a good position for them. The front of the seat has a bit of a ridge, which I can feel in my legs, but I'm assuming that will soften out over time.


Overall I feel the chair is pretty stiff. I came from an Ikea Markus chair, which when I go to sit in again, feels mushy and soft. The reason I wanted a change is because that chair basically has no back support and the seat cushion is just completely gone after 5+ years of use. You can see indention's where I sit and it basically goes straight to the wood/metal below. This chair feels much more supportive and I hope the foam breaks in a bit over time. I wouldn't say it's too hard, as I sat in this for ~12 hours the first day I got it just trying a bunch of different things out while I was working from home. I absolutely love how easy it is to just turn off the lock and basically have a rocking chair/recliner, or drop the back out and lay almost flat. I have a TV mounted right above my desk/monitors, and I'm already really enjoying just laying back and watching TV that way. It will freak you out at first, thinking it's going to tip over, but after doing it a few times and realizing it's still pretty stable, it's nice just knowing you have that option.


So to sum it up, If you are the same size as me, I wouldn't worry about the fit so much, I think you will be fine. Just make sure you understand it's a bit firm and might take some getting used to depending on what your chairs in the past have been, but will also give more support than other older chairs. The quality feels pretty top notch and putting it together by myself wasn't difficult. Let me know if you have any other specific questions and I'll do my best to answer.",Craig Cooper,3,2019-04-24 10:46:50+00:00

lRL691QA_vI,I am currently a college student and was looking for a good all around chair for school work and gaming. I would definitely use this chair for hours a day. The only thing would be for summer break I would have to disassemble the chair in order to transport it back home. Basically I would have to disassemble and reassemble the chair 2-3 times a year for transporting to and from college.  Would you recommend the titan for my specific situation or should I wait till I‚Äôm out of college? Thanks,2,Marcus Fleming,2019-04-03 23:59:59+00:00,"It wouldnt be very fun. A bit of hassle but you could do it. Probably just to save the trouble I'd say maybe wait. 
You would have to use the mini little tool it comes w/, or get your own allen wrench set to take off the arms & the hydraulic from the base of the chair. All assembled it is kinda heavy, you can move it by yourself but its awkward & heavy. I've moved it a few times myself already. 
If you do it just for when you go home for the summer & when you go back to school, keep the instructions & think of keeping the tool handy/get your own allen set. If your planning on breaking it down more than that for home vacations/small breaks. wait.
But for going home for the summer & school. You could break it down.",Crue Steele,1,2019-04-04 06:41:50+00:00

So far its holding up nicely! Still no tears at the moment, Its still comfortable, but I feel like some of the comfortableness goes away after 2 years maybe. Its hard to explain. I still enjoy sitting in it, but I'm at my desk for very long periods of time. So I feel for someone using it casually or gaming/streaming for 8 hours, they will be good & happy still.
If someone is looking for something very comfy they may not like this for a long hall choice, its firm & I like that. Around 10 hours of no stretch breaks thats when I start to get uncomfortable, but thats more so something on what I'm doing than the chair.

Long shot question, I've narrowed my choice to the Titan, Noblechairs Epic or Hero and N.Seat Pro 600. On the off chance, can you add any insight to my decision making? The Epic and Pro 600 can probably be last on the list because they have, respectively, raised seat edges and a plastic wheel base.",Tommygunn,2,2019-02-08 09:12:21+00:00

And I've been telling some people latley about my left arm rest.
My left arm rest is becoming wobbly, but ik that is because of when i turn to my right to stand up, the arm is going under my desk, then when i stand up, the chair rises a bit, and lodges the armrest under the desk. I'm trying to be more careful with it. I dont think I'm in any risk of the arm falling off, its not that bad. But the right side is perfectly fine.
And a little bit of squeaking in the chair when you first go to lean back, but its sooooooo faint. Its not like a loud typical work chair squeak. 
hope this helped you out :)

lRL691QA_vI,"Really enjoyed your review!  Nice and blunt, also good to know you didnt get 'gifted' the chair so totally unbiased :)   

My own chiar broke a few days ago after about 6 years hard use (4 - 8 hrs a day) so i cant complain, but I am looking at the Titan as a replacement, but its right at the top of my scale price wise and worried it wont match my short ass body.  The inbuild lumbar (however you pronounce it! lol) suport really has me sold though.  

It seems all the other 'gaming chair' alternatives all have those strap on cushions which IMHO look more of a problem / i wont bother to use them after a few weeks... (take note manufacturers!).  I also think a lot of them have the shoulder bracers which might be great for those of a slim build, but I have quite broad shoulders as an ex swimmer, would probably push my shoulders forward rather than 'hug' me...

I also looked at the Noblechairs ICON and yes, lovely looking, good quality, and great reviews, but no in built lumbar support other wise i would stretch to their asking price. At first I also looked at a cheaper alternative and narrowed it down to a GT Omega Pro, that seems to have all the same specs (steel frame, cold formed foam, etc) just lacking the internal lumbar support but it was only ¬£200... so that is my second choice... The only worry I have about the Titan since i come in at the short ass range of 5'8""-9"" and 'medium build'....  Would it fit me?

(I'd give you a weight but seriously the batteries on the weighing scales have run out... honest.... Reading this now looks like im having a laugh but seriously, you couldnt make this up :D)

So medium build.... a Robert Downey Jr, just slightly more love handles?   Anyway....  

Seriously leaning towards the Titan, I might be on the shorter / lighter end of their scale but now and again i like to cros my legs and take all concideration of my posture out of concideration... which the smaller chairs probably wouldnt allow, I also eat kebabs at my desk and (god forbid) drop some chillie sauce on my chair (so fake leather FTW!)....

Q.",1,Qpid Stunt,2019-01-24 00:38:53+00:00,"@Crue Steele  @Thor Sine - So the chair was frustratingly sat in the local delivery company's depot so I couldnt even collect from them directly on Saturday, and had to wait until Monday so it is 2 Working Days, not a biggie, just thought i would clarify that for Friday orders.  Its very well packaged, without being wasteful.

After watching a few Youtube videos prior to delivery, it only took about 15 minutes to build and that was in a tight space with my dogs trying to help... so pretty easy.

The parts are really well built and of a very high quality, infact the only thing i would say could be improved on were the little plastic covers that go over the bolts that hold the back of the chair to the base.... they just felt a little cheap compared to the rest... but then the rest of the chair is such high quality, they look fine really.

I've said, I am 5'8"" so just at the lower limit of the Titan, but I wanted the inbuild lumbar support.

It is firm but not overly and its very comfy, i can just start to feel the seat 'break in' and give a little more after the 2 - 3 weeks I have had it.
Shoulder wise it keeps me in place and I dont move side to side
Leg wise its just perfect, the edge of the seat right at the joint of my knees
I have noticed my skinny ass has a bit more room to move left or right in the seat (possibly around the lumbar support), but only after sitting crossed legged, so do need to correct my position now and again - however this is very rarely and more my fault :) 
The lumbar support feels spot on and adds that firmness in the right area
Being so short for this I do only have it about 1"" above the lowest height setting and the seat tilted back ever so slightly, any higher and i wouldnt be able to touch the floor with my feet flat on the ground.  This does still give you the full 'spring' as you sit down in the chair, and I could raise it a bit more for tip toes or even put my feet on the legs.
Very stable if its laid all the way back, not that I have slept on it... yet.  :) 
I have room to cross my legs and still sit comfortably on there.
Cannot really comment on the armrests as my desk is pretty big so my arms rest on that, but the times i have leant it back to just watch a movie they have been fine.

Overall the build quality is really, really good and I am very happy with the chair!  It might seem expencive but when I thought about it, I spend from 4 to 8 hours a day in it mainly gaming and a little work, so spreading the cost over the years that this will last me, its nothing.  I also went with the fabric finish as I had and know that PU leather does peel after a while, I know SecretLabs use a high quality one, but still.. didnt want to risk it.

Anyway I hope that helps, any specific questions please feel free to ask away.",Qpid Stunt,2,2019-02-13 08:50:14+00:00
lRL691QA_vI,"Really enjoyed your review!  Nice and blunt, also good to know you didnt get 'gifted' the chair so totally unbiased :)   

My own chiar broke a few days ago after about 6 years hard use (4 - 8 hrs a day) so i cant complain, but I am looking at the Titan as a replacement, but its right at the top of my scale price wise and worried it wont match my short ass body.  The inbuild lumbar (however you pronounce it! lol) suport really has me sold though.  

It seems all the other 'gaming chair' alternatives all have those strap on cushions which IMHO look more of a problem / i wont bother to use them after a few weeks... (take note manufacturers!).  I also think a lot of them have the shoulder bracers which might be great for those of a slim build, but I have quite broad shoulders as an ex swimmer, would probably push my shoulders forward rather than 'hug' me...

I also looked at the Noblechairs ICON and yes, lovely looking, good quality, and great reviews, but no in built lumbar support other wise i would stretch to their asking price. At first I also looked at a cheaper alternative and narrowed it down to a GT Omega Pro, that seems to have all the same specs (steel frame, cold formed foam, etc) just lacking the internal lumbar support but it was only ¬£200... so that is my second choice... The only worry I have about the Titan since i come in at the short ass range of 5'8""-9"" and 'medium build'....  Would it fit me?

(I'd give you a weight but seriously the batteries on the weighing scales have run out... honest.... Reading this now looks like im having a laugh but seriously, you couldnt make this up :D)

So medium build.... a Robert Downey Jr, just slightly more love handles?   Anyway....  

Seriously leaning towards the Titan, I might be on the shorter / lighter end of their scale but now and again i like to cros my legs and take all concideration of my posture out of concideration... which the smaller chairs probably wouldnt allow, I also eat kebabs at my desk and (god forbid) drop some chillie sauce on my chair (so fake leather FTW!)....

Q.",1,Qpid Stunt,2019-01-24 00:38:53+00:00,"@Crue Steele I think it will be easily big enough, even crossed legged, what was most important was the inbuilt lumbar support... I can easily see myself not using a cushion after a while if I got the Omega, so I have gone for it and bought the Titan.

It says next day delivery on their site so will hopefully arrive tomorrow however thats a Saturday, so might actually be 'next day' but only working days... fingers crossed so i can give it a good session :)

I'll update after building :)",Qpid Stunt,1,2019-01-25 10:56:07+00:00

Unfortunately, they seem to think the wobbly armrests are normal. I'm still trying to talk to them but haven't heard back. I'm really hoping they at least send me one replacement left armrest. If they don't I think if I stick a piece of thick paper or cardboard inside the plastic shaft it should stay more secure and not wobble as I rest my elbows on it. 
Needless to say, I'm so disappointed. Only have had it 7 days. Might return it, but it costs so much to return these. There's still a chance support will reach out again today (maybe they just take awhile to respond). I'll keep you posted.",John Lungo,0,2019-01-25 08:27:18+00:00

But thats because when I get up from my chair, i spin to my right. And that has been placing the arm under my desk, and when i get up, the chair rises a bit, and it puts pressure on the left arm rest under against the desk. So thats kinda my fault, I've been careful to not do that any more. Idk if I suggested to you or not, I dont think you should have a lose arm rest, and would suggest emailing Secret Labs about a replacement arm. They sell chair parts individually so it should be to far fetched to ask for just an arm rest & not a whole new chair.",Crue Steele,0,2019-01-24 17:59:16+00:00

It does suck that they only have 1 color for the NAPA Leather. And the different one the Omega has isn't that much better...... They do need to try and come up w/ a better looking design if they want to sell the NAPA Leather for that price I think.
I have heard some good stuff about Noblechair! I've never had but do suggest people take a look at them. I did look like another good chair choice. If you get a Noblechair hit me back up & Tell me what you think!",Crue Steele,1,2019-01-17 19:18:27+00:00

I have received my Titan chair earlier today, SecretLabs estimated at first delivery by January 23rd, and in reality it took them less than a week (I purchased the chair this Monday). Very impressive start of the relationship with the company, i like it. I had no trouble assembling the chair; although, I'd admit it would be way faster if I had an extra pair of hands to assist me. Overall, the instructions is very straight forward and should not give any issues to the customer. Now, I am finally seating in my new Titan chair, and oh my it feels SO NICE. Definitely was worth the investment, I would recommend to people who look for a gaming chair to pick Titan if the budget allows. I am 6.1 ft and 200 pounds and the chair feels extremely comfortable. Thank you once again for this video, really helpful information.",TooBigBirdy,1,2019-01-05 02:37:27+00:00

I feel like in your case it would come down to the weight they can hold & personal prefrence of what they offer in the chairs. :)
If you do get one let me know what you think when it comes!

Honestly all I have to do is close the door into my room and it's fine. I used a sharpie to cover up some noticeable marks and for the most part the main places it got damaged were on the front of the chair, so if I'm sitting on it no one will see it unless they're sitting in the chair and they turn their head and look at the back of the chair. And besides I'm not a streamer or anything so I'm not trying to impress anyone. All I can say is that it's much better than my last chair or any other chairs I've ever had to be honest and the damage is only cosmetic and so minimal that I don't care enough to do anything about it other than cover up the parts I can.",Toast Buster,1,2019-01-16 23:24:05+00:00

But it's fine and it obviously doesn't affect how the chair feels since theres only a few small holes on the top and back of the chair.

It‚Äôs nothing like sitting on concrete and nothing like sitting on wood. 
It is firm with a bit of cushion. I was reading into today about the seat and the material it‚Äôs made of. It‚Äôs on the website. I think it was called cold foam, this is foam that is meant to hold its shape over long periods of time. The seat is not complete cushion. It is like it‚Äôs padded. 
I had heard chairs that have a lot cushion, compact down over time, it becomes more worn out where you start to feel the actual bottom of the seat.

Will review in a week or two but had well considered all the ergo, monitor and table considerations beforehand. I've got some adjustable height with the ROG PG348 monitor (34"" close-sitting), old small kitchen wooden table which is almost just right with height but lacks enough depth and needs to be another 6 inches or more away from where it is. Anyways, thanks again and let's hope these keep showing durability over time",Daniel Teale,1,2018-12-05 03:38:54+00:00

Glad you liked the video!
I'd go with the Titan! Mainly just because of your height, you would be just into the Titan threshold, where Omega, your a little over it. And they say its max load for height is 5'9''. 
But I think overall it would be a personal preference for you on which one you like the look of more & how much you really want to spend. Hope this helped :) And thanks again for the nice comment :)

lRL691QA_vI,"i am canadian. This chair is 35% more expensive. On a deal, I can get it for $563, the all black one recently out. I am 6'0 and hella thin (as you can see in my picture) at around 120 lbs. Would you recommend it? Also, how much of a benefit is the high backrest for someone at our height range. Right now I have an office chair which isn't necessarily bad, but I do feel like i'd just like to be ""locked in"" more. Does this chair give you that?",1,CakeJam,2018-11-05 01:34:22+00:00,"After using this chair, I would just recommend anyone try and find a chair that is built for people w/ height of 6 foot and over. The backrest i like a lot! the lumbar support is completely adjustable. I use to work in an office where some of the office chairs backs would only go half way up your back, and my at home chair before this was the same. When i would lean I'd be fine, but those moments when you actually want to just lean back for a moment and fully rest your top back & your head on something, its nice to know it. Has your back lol. 
But if its expensive which I know it can be for people, it was a very ""Big"" buy for me. I'd say search around, but look for something that does appeal to taller people. This also had me sold because its a gaming chair, so it also fit my streams on Twitch.

The leather is a bit expensive but that's the price you gotta pay for the best materials üòÅ I could only stretch to the PU peasant version.,kenzohkw,1,2018-09-25 22:52:33+00:00

lRL691QA_vI,Hey dude! Is the chair stiff in the seat cushion? Or does it get softer? Got a DX-Racer R-series now and the seat is borderline rock solid.,1,Ville Melg√©n,2018-09-12 22:07:25+00:00,"i say its firm. Not hard, but no real cushion. But does have some padding on it. Hard to explain really lol. I sit in this chair for 8-10 hours a day and I'm very happy w/ it",Crue Steele,0,2018-09-14 07:18:47+00:00
lRL691QA_vI,"Hey man good video! I have a Vertagear PL6000 right now and the seat  is very stiff!! Lol..  also the lumbar pillow that it comes with doesn't fit on the chair very well.. It has no way to really wrap it/tie it up I have to go up and over the whole entire back and then zip tie it in the back because it's not tight enough and the straps keep popping off. But from what everybody is saying and what I've read those chairs are very firm pro probably just like mine. Almost makes it uncomfortable was kind of hoping it was going to break in but it's been a few weeks now and it still isn't comfortable. The nice thing about it is that the seat is perforated(has holes) so I don't sweat a lot during long sessions but the lumbar support is just a nightmare. So I guess my question is How good is the lumbar support on that one? how far does it stick out or protrude can you actually feel it and notice it when you Crank It Up? Cuz I'm running out of time to return the one I have and for $400 I feel like I should be pretty happy with it you know.. so I was just curious on your input about the lumbar support I'm also 6'3 270lbs so I needed the bigger chair lol.. also I almost forgot I feel like the seat on my chair is not that deep feels like I'm sitting on half of my butt lmao. I'll have to check out the website to see how deep the seed is but I was just curious about the lumbar support because that's important to me even like you said you still have to put in the effort to have good posture. But thanks, hopefully I can get a response from you. I enjoyed your video bro! keep it",1,Larry Allard,2018-09-12 03:29:45+00:00,"HEY LARRY! Thanks for the comment & nice words dude, glad you liked my video :) 
the chair has pretty decent to good lumbar support that it comes with. Idk if you saw my first original video, I went more in depth about what the chair had to offer. And it does come w/ its own lumbar support in it, it has a knob on right side of the chair you can adjust, I have mine all the way supported, just recently I have been thinking about getting a lumbar pillow. I raised my desk up to help my height more which the level of the desk is level w/ the arm wrests. so i cant really tuck my chair all the way in, unless I drop the arms down. So I'm at a cross roads on my streams sometimes with, do I want back support or arm support lol. 
when I choose the back support road I'm perfectly fine and comfortable. Still need to get up here & there to stretch, I tell everyone I sleep then I'm gaming. I'm gaming sometimes for like 8 hours straight to more sometimes. But I'm very happy w/ the chairs current lumbar support. Do note from what I've seen, I know Secret Labs offers lumbar pillows, however, I've noticed they have the Omega lumbar pillow for the normal chairs & also a ""smaller"" pillow, for their I think V2 Thrown. I dont think they have any pillows to help further w/ the Titan's Lumbar system. Over the weekend I was using a bed pillow for one of my streams. But that was because I didn't lower my arm wrest to position the chair for better back support, so my posture was defiantly leaning in towards the screen.
And really for the cushion support, I do think mine has broken in very well since I use it more, I definitely have a butt ""imprint"" on my seat, but I still find it good & comfortable. I know my discomforts that I have because, I don't take the breaks i should be taking, I don't go out for walks which i should since i sit so much. If your going to be using the chair for like 4-8 hours, I think you will be very happy with it and love it very much. If your going to use it more than that, you'll still be fine, just know to stretch & take some good size breaks so your body doesn't cramp up like mine :P 
Sorry for the essay letter! hope that answers it for you, any more questions, just write back or you can come by my stream on Twitch, I'm always live on week days

lRL691QA_vI,"I bought a GT omega gaming chair and ive been using it for almost 2 years and its HORRIBLE. its so bad. No lumbar support whatsoever.

I seriously considered the orange or ash, but the black, ""carbon"", and gold touches sold me. I use my chair a lot, for streaming/gaming and photo editing. It's important to me to have a good place to plant my butt, and more importantly my arms/back whenever I'm at my desk. A better desk setup comes next, but a good chair, as you said, is very important.",1,Tony Allen,2018-09-05 09:22:40+00:00,"AWESOME DUDE!!! Glad you like my review :) I have to say now I am thinking of getting a lumbar pillow because I am gaming & sitting here for veryyyy long periods of time! My desk table are level w/ the chairs arm rests so I cant pull my chair in all the way i would like. So I am thinking of investing to a lumbar pillow as well. Just something I want to tell you after 2 months of solid streaming/gaming. If your set up is similar, maybe think about it, but that depends if your legit just sleeping & then spending all day in the chair then going back to sleep :P lol

She sits in it for hours of an evening after she gets off work to play the Xbox and watches Netflix....I've tried it out¬†and I would say I find it to be a little more comfortable than my DX Racer (Iron Series) due to the lumber area¬†sticking out more because it¬†arches into my lower spine area¬†somewhat more...
I don't think I'd change¬†the position of the lumber area even it was adjustable because of the backrests¬†outward curve that seems to align with my wife's back and my back¬†pretty well...(If it aint broke don't fix it kinda thing) Don't get me wrong¬†It would have been cool to have an adjustable built in lumbar support¬†but even that doesn't always make the chair any better for sitting in if the chair is well designed to begin with. 
Lumbar support is a nice feature to have but not a necessity with this chair whereas my DXRacer chair¬†would benefit more from having that¬†feature.
The overall style of the Epic Series is sleek and the stitching screams quality. I would¬†definitely recommend this chair despite It's lack of lumbar adjustability....",xboxgamer,1,2018-09-26 05:38:46+00:00

If I sit more closer to the edge of the seat their is more cushion there, because I dont sit on the edge there. But even where it becomes more compact where you sit every day or most of the time, i find it still comfortable after more than a year of using. I'm still sitting in this chair for like 8 hours a day.

The width is very good. I know they stick out, its just the look of it, but they do not push my shoulders at all. The chair shoulders extend more out to the sides than sticking out front, so they don't push on your shoulders at all. I've never had any issues w/ it.

Anyways if you could turn back time would you still purchase this chair? Cause I'm lookin into it as well. I just don't trust the reviews on their website, facebook page and from youtubers that were obviously sponsored. 


Looking through the more genuine reviews via googling I can see that their rated on average a 2/5 by the majority which many pointed out about their shady marketing tactics, e.g ""deleting bad reviews from their web and social media pages"" and their average customer service when dealing with servicing.

ig7EJPdpRdc,"Imma just share my opinion here, don't buy ""gaming"" or ""bucket seat"" chairs.
Get actual ergonomic and ""24 hour"" chairs, unless you really want a bucket/ racing seat for a racing simulator.

My points why I don't like these ""gaming"" chairs. (Sorry for possibly bad English)
- Most of these chairs come from basically the same manufacturer,  the wheels/base/arm wrests/handles are identical across many different models (look at corsair, dxracer, omega, they're all basically the same)
- The base starts squeaking quite a bit after a bit over 1 year of usage.
- The arm wrests don't have cushions, although are quite adjustible also feel flimsy. When ""locked"" in place there's still a ton of wiggle. My left arm wrest also ripped at the side after about 1 year of usage, nothing that would bother me or I would feel but still not good quality.
- Although the cushions do remain soft for a long time, I've sat in mine for about 3 years now and never got the feeling like I'm sitting on a piece of wood like ikea chairs after 6 months.
- Cheap and fake leather with poor ventilation. It doesn't personally bother me because I'm used to heat/ not having air conditioning but many people I know suffer from sticky  and wet backs or assess from these seats, especailly during summer.
- Back support is basically non-exsistant, the back is literally a straight line and the shoulders of the chair literally makes it impossible to have your shoulders actually straight down and ergnomic instead of angled forward. Even with the backrest at a 90 degree angle I barely feel the neck pillow and it offers 0 support. The lumbar pillow could help with this but personally I think it's way too firm and thick, making it do more harm than good.",1,[ ],2020-07-28 20:09:43+00:00,@Tank Vue Cool to hear. I got my omega chair new but heavily discounted so I'm not mad because of the money I spent but for everyone thinking of buying new for the full price I'd recommend going for something else.,[ ],0,2020-08-28 08:55:14+00:00

I m thinking to buy this chair but I am scared the seat lengh could be too short for me (I am 1m86, 85kg)
Can I ask how tall are you, and with what horizontal seat position are you using the chair?
Another question, when I look at the back, it seems the mesh is a bit loose: in the center area and close to lumbar support. 
is it beacause you used this chair intensively? do you feel the comfort and/or the mesh support has changed since the beginning?

I use both horizontal seat positions at various times, sliding it all the way back gets you nice and close to the lumbar support, sliding it forward gives your legs a little more freedom. If I'm typing a lot I'll slide it back.

The mesh at the top is entirely my fault and actually happened when I moved house, things shuffled in the back of the truck and some furniture came into contact with it but it didn't actually change the comfort of the chair in any way since it's right at the top. The lumbar support and middle of the mesh take most of your weight.

If the mesh ended up like that through normal use, it'd definitely be covered under warranty. The seat mesh is still as tight as it's ever been. :)",Jay RPG,2,2019-09-16 16:37:52+00:00

That wouldn't be the chairs fault. That's just a product of two fabric surfaces rubbing against eachother. It would happen with any fabric chair. 

Not having it on carpet would probably help if that is the case. Get one of those plastic office mats. I go those since I have carpet and didn't want to get stuck on it.

The vibe seems to be love it or hate it. 

I'm in the former. I love it. I came from a shitty office chair and had shitty posture so I wanted a chair that would support that. I read that it was very firm but didn't see that as terrible given what I came from. It's no couch/sofa but it isn't a dining chair either. 

Right now I'm trying to find some cleaning advice. I vacuum mine often and I don't eat when sitting in it. However dust or sweat stains appear over time like anything. 

But it's still solid, no damage. No complaints from me. 

I have a theory the negative reviews are coming from people who bought a chair that was too big or small for them. A particular theory for 'the chairs lumbar is shit/too big, the sides are splitting, I can feel the structure through the seat' is that those individuals are much larger then they realise. 
Kind of like those obese people on airliners who don't acknowledge how obnoxious they are when their fat rolls are on top of the person next to them and blame the airline for not having larger seats (No offence to those that are self-couscous about it. It's an example of a lack of taking responsibility). That example is extreme and I'm not saying every bad reviewer is obese, just a similar mindset and lack of self awareness.

Likewise, the people who say its too firm came from a couch like chair or they're really light. 

Personally, I'm around 6ft and a pretty lanky guy at around 60-70kg.

Is that you wouldn't have to worry as much about accidents. This I'm a bit more hesitant on.

VXkbeTUhGV4,The thing with the leather and it getting dirty or dusty AND seeing it.. then you can clean it off.. with the softweave .. you wont notice it get dirty or dusty.. its like an old pillow cusion.. you give it a smack and see how much dust flies out of it and realize you have been sitting in that either butt ass nude or just in general... Id rather have the leather and know its getting dusty cause at that point it just takes a couple seconds to give it a quick wipe with a micro fiber..  another thing with the soft weave is that dirt and dust will get locked into it.. its like having a thick carpet on the floor.. sure vacuum it.. but it will only get whats on the top layer... or you will think you got it all.. but really you havent...,0,MrJack Dempsey,2020-08-31 16:40:56+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

What a load of shit.  Get real,  that chair sucks and Secret Lab is a scam.

VXkbeTUhGV4,"Guys... Comeon now...  PU leather is pureed fragments of leather scrap mixed with polyurethane.  PU leather is to leather what dogshit is to potpourri - restated, it isn't. Look, I've got no beef with a gilded lily but lets be honest here.  A premium chair is one that will last a decade, from materials that simply will not break, or deform, over the course of time.  Prime examples of high-end mass produced chairs are Steelcase and Herman Miller; and these chairs can run up to $2000 - for solid ergonomic chairs.  Make no mistake, we're not talking executive, hand crafted leather, one offs - we're talking about high-end chairs intended to do their job well and last forever.  These Titans are - at best - the top of the very bottom. Inflation is a bitch, and just because durable goods have become prohibitively expensive for some doesn't mean that the scale just resets and we're now on poverty time. 

It doesn't mean these chairs don't have a place, simply that these reviews all misrepresent what that place actually is.

Hell, I'm personally looking at one of these chairs for a light duty use in my project room.  I think they're fun, crappy, chairs that will likely last a couple years - tops.  You would do well to think of these products in the same light.  If you can't do that, save up a few more dollars, get something like a Steelcase Leap V.2...  I bought one - with custom foam and fabric - shipped for $1100, just last year.  It's bombproof and will last at least a decade. These simply won't. 

They're not high end, don't be misled into believing they are.",2,Project: Jericho,2020-04-27 18:53:45+00:00,Not everyone has a fucking thousand dollars laying around. These chairs are less than HALF of that.,Fuhrdaddy,4,2020-04-30 22:21:03+00:00

VXkbeTUhGV4,"It is not leather so stop calling it leather Is PU leather, it's not real. Real leather does not flake. They use it on chairs and couch because it is easy to clean without washing it in the washing machine. There's a huge different. Real leather is much more durable and age well with time. That's why it is much more expensive. The softweave is a fabric material is a very bad choice for furniture simply because it is fabric. Like your shirt and underwear is made of fabric. Try don't wash your shirt and underwear for a week or a month in the laundry machine and see how bad it looks and smell. That's why they don't use fabric material for chairs and couches",2,Justice League,2020-04-19 03:19:54+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

VXkbeTUhGV4,"Great vid! I'm still undecided on which chair to use not bc of material but bc of color scheme. I was initially going to go with the PU leather black stealth (triple black) but I think I'm going to go with the SoftWeave. Now the only question is cookies & cream or charcoal blue. How does the SoftWeave cookies and cream stand up to stains?? My concern is if I'm eating or drinking something and it does fall on the chair, will it be easy to clean?? That is the main reason why I'm torn between both colors... Also just so you know, PU leather, or polyurethane leather, is an artificial leather made of thermoplastic polymer used for making furniture or shoes. 100% PU leather is completely artificial and is considered vegan. It's not too ""breathable"" and tends to crack/flake off. PU leather doesn't absorb water and that's why its easier to clean but it won't ever develop the same luster or patina as real genuine leather. On the other hand, REAL LEATHER (The $799 Napa Leather version) comes from a real animal and is actual hide therefore more breathable and will not crack/flake off; it will definitely last a lifetime and will look/feel better with time.",0,Manny,2020-04-10 12:40:49+00:00,@Big E Thanks!

I‚Äôm worried that the seat will get stained after a couple of months.",3,weishg,2019-04-23 10:55:44+00:00,"I have used it for almost close to half a year now and so far the seat still look fresh and stain-free. You gotta do your part to maintain it by either wipe it with a moist micro-fibre cloth or spray Febreze Fabric Refresher Spray to eliminate odor and bacteria. If you still have concern, I guess it's safer for you to get the charcoal version.",Andy Xu,0,2019-04-24 04:52:06+00:00
qvnR4BChZjQ,"Great video. I have a hard time deciding which one to get between throne and omega. Chart sizes put me right on the 2. Do you have any tips to help choose better?
And even if we don't live in a tropical country, it's still very humid here during summer, do you think overall the fabric will last longer than leather?

It all voice down to your budget. If you have excess budget, go for Omega otherwise Throne is good enough for you. Fabric will definitely last longer as PU leather tends to peel when there is heat and humidity in the environment, hence the safer choice is to go for the Softweave Fabric!",Andy Xu,0,2019-04-16 01:37:25+00:00

The titan suits me perfectly. The seat isn't as firm as people exaggerate it to be. It's firm sure, but it's way better than sitting on a mesh chair that basically has zero cushion.

Otherwise, me and the company will get sued and everyone gets into a lot of trouble. So you can drop this claim. Now that we cleared that, let me tell you this. I love this chair so much, it is so comfortable for me that I had to buy a sit/stand desk because I just get buried in it and don't move at all. Having said that I've never tested other gaming chairs I'm guessing they must be similar too, but compared to my old chair this is the most comfortable thing. So it is well worth $400 imho. Also I've been sitting in it since the day it arrived, it doesn't squeak, it haven't aged. It is still in day 1 condition.

I myself do not own a gaming chair yet, but I am looking into getting this one in the charcoal and blue softweave.",PunkRockBenWilson,1,2019-06-04 21:28:28+00:00
ZSycSfUwH6E,"Great review like always iPhonedo. For those considering this chair, I would really recommend finding long term reviews. After owning this chair for only 1 year and 3 months, it has begun to peel and Secretlabs are putting this down to general wear and tear. I would certainly look elsewhere. Just for some context, I have a 100% leather couch (6 years old) and PU leather dining chairs (3 years old) that are in the same environment and have not shown the same sign of ageing.

ZSycSfUwH6E,"Marketing gimmick because of all these reviews, i ended up buying Titan chair. First day today, it's an okay chair. Not the best out there in market. The  pillow got ripped very easily and is not at all of high quality - actually feels cheap. Installation steps were not that easy but they were not bad either but it could be just me, i usually get chairs pre-installed. I had tried a Herman Miller Embody before this ( which is 3 times price of this chair ), i felt the base of that chair was too hard. This chair is not even close to the quality of a herman miller but it does  feel solid. Remember this is a task chair not executive chair ( make sure you read the difference on internet before getting into it.  Return policy is a total crap on this chair, once you order you are stuck so watch out! 

Update: I informed Support and they promised replacement for pillow and side knobs. But now after a week i see the foam on the base has a dip in it. Its like a hole on the lower side of the chair.",0,Neeraj Sharma,2018-09-01 14:19:22+00:00,"One Year more into the chair. - Still regret this decision.

ZSycSfUwH6E,The chair that I have doesn't have a knob to adjust the lumbar support. It uses a lumbar support pillow which never stays in place and for this reason I absolutely hate it. Whatever you do don't get a gaming chair that relies on a pillow for lumbar support. I spent $400  on my chair and the only thing I like about it is that the padding is nicer that my $100 generic chair.

Looking at all the main chairs, they all seem to use the same base mechanism and armrest design. The only big difference with this chair is the integrated lumbar support, whereas most others use a sliding pillow. I'd rather have something that locks in place and doesn't need adjusting every time I get up. I like the higher backrest and wider stance, since I'm tall. Still need to see some long-term reviews about the foam durability. Subbed!",0,skrutor,2018-04-07 22:59:22+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan
ZSycSfUwH6E,"This chair is almost as good as my SteelSeries. Which cost twice as much. But this is a lot more comfortable to sit in after prolonged periods. For a gaming chair this really is deceiving.

¬†Because I've had a lot of gaming chairs in the past. Such as DXRacer, AK Racing, & XRocker. 

This may not be as well-known of a company but don't let that fool you. This chair is extremely high-quality. 

There's only one other chair that I've had that comes close to this. Being DXRacer's King series which retail around $700. 

For just around $500. You get probably the best built and certainly the most comfortable gaming chair on the market. 

Only drawback the Omega is that it doesn't have a pass through like other gaming chairs so the lumbar support isn't adjustable. 

But having a full solid backrest actually you don't need it I have found. If lumbar absolutely is important to you. 

You can go for the secretlab elite which is more like an executive CEO version. That chair has built in lumbar. But really for the money you cannot go wrong here. Good Review here!! :b",0,BlazinNSoul,2018-04-06 23:40:59+00:00,Shill detected.,B C,0,2019-02-04 23:15:41+00:00

Thanks for watching.,4,Digital Cynics,2020-05-18 18:08:09+00:00,It definitely varies person to person but I prefer a larger chair to sit in just because I like the extra room so an XL for you would most definitely work great.

Thanks for watching.,4,Digital Cynics,2020-05-18 18:08:09+00:00,"@Digital Cynics Thanks for the reply! Of the 2 Titans I'm leaning toward the XL for the extra height (just a half inch, but could matter), the more stable base, and less bolstering. Not certain it's worth the extra $70 though, and I'd prefer the charcoal cloth, which you can't get on XL. So... still debating. I really, really want that adjustable headrest, so if I was certain the Ergo2 was big enough I would just do that, no question. I'd happily pay $500 for an Ergochair2 with better arms, built for larger people.",Gary CO,1,2020-05-20 22:48:26+00:00

So for example, a budget ergonomic office style chair is the Autonomous Ergochair V2, however while the armrests are 4D directional, they do not lock in place aside from up and down, which was a huge no-go for me. This is actually something I liked about my Secretlab chair... The armrests, while way too hard and poorly angled in my opinion, locked in all directions and never moved on me during use. The Ergochair v2 looks like a gust of wind would move the armrests.

The way I see it, a chair is like your bed, in that you spend a LOT of time on it. You're supposed to invest in a good mattress, so I don't think a chair is any different, considering the long term damage you can do to your body from poor posture and incorrect spinal curvature. With that said, office chairs I've used either at work or at home that I liked were the Knoll ReGeneration, Knoll Remix, Humanscale Freedom, HermanMiller Verus, HermanMiller Aeron, Steelcase Gesture, and Steelcase Amia. My personal chair is the Steelcase Gesture, which was over $1000 and definitely not for most people.

Im pretty sure those are all over $600 chairs, and keep in mind that MOST I've only used at work and some for limited amounts of time... But you can really feel the quality in them. I'd say the Steelcase chairs and the HermanMiller chairs are my favorite... But they're also both the most expensive.",Sgt Nooodle,1,2020-06-11 05:06:29+00:00

ywRs5qgLLIE,"I got my stark chair last week it's beautiful, but also its the most uncomfortable chair I've ever sat on. It's like siting on the bleachers at a high school game. I'm 5 foot 5 inches, the website says this chair is for my size but clearly it's not. The chair sits so high and the base is so long that when I sit my feet can't touch the ground.

0NFF3vOrSmU,"Thanks for the review - I also like your style...i'm considering buying one. I currently have a 'Main Gear' equivalent, which is great except for the damn lumbar pillow which is never in the right place. Can you please talk a bit more about the built-in lumbar support?  Specifically, most pillows push out (into your back) around 2-3 inches, at around 8-10 inches above the seat deck.  I've watched many videos, including plenty of guys turning the knob - but none of them show how much the profile of the seat changes, i.e., how much it 'pushes out', or 'how high off the seat deck' it is.  I've reached out to Secret Lab, but they literally don't know.  Thanks man!  BTW, I'm around 6-one, 175.",0,David Baron,2020-07-06 17:36:03+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

In some pictures and videos I've seen (including on the actual Secretlab website) the ash chairs look like they have a blue tint to them. But in others, it looks like a neutral gray. Would you describe your chair as being blue-ish or just plain gray? Also, I see this video is more than a year old now. Do you have any quick thoughts on it you could share after using the chair for so long?

https://www.thomann.de/intl/mey_chair_systems_efs_93_foot_rest.htm?offid=1&affid=264

i looked into noblechairs but i felt(!) the Secretlabs are more my style. there are some design features i dont get on noblechairs like the metal logo that will stick into your back. i read that on some reviews and overall i decided to go with the secretlab. But keep in mind i got NO experience with an actual Noblechair myself.

all these ""gaming""chairs are pretty hard,its more about the constant ability to tilt and change positions smoothly with this chair. but its in fact one of the less harder chairs i ownded so far.
The headrest is a big help,yes. the lumbar support is THE feature that makes me love it. I got no pain anymore...i tend to have a bad sitting posture and now its much better.
Its NOT the best chair for guitar players...you would want a chair where you can get rid of the armrest...titl it back or something. but havent found a really great chair for this so far.

nOsE0JfmWv0,"Since I have an Omega Stealth and watching this video and others like Noblechairs Hero and Boulies Master Series and watching the Assembling of The Omega and Titan and Noblechairs Hero my score for the Comfort of the Omega 10/10, Style 8/10, The Backrest Assembled onto the Seat 3/10, The Five Star Base and Wheels 10/10, Red Stitching 8/10, Stitching on the seat 1/10. As you can see their are two very low scores. The stitching pattern on my seat are not accurate - the one on the left does not match the one on the right. The Backrest on the seat is not accurate and you can even see this on the Titan in this video. 


When I watched an assembling of the Nobles Hero I noticed that the Backrest on the seat was accurate so 10/10. I like the style of the plastic covers and the wheels on the sides of the seats on the Omega and Titan and Boulies Master Series. I dislike the ones on the Noble Hero and every other Sport Chairs that use this old style. 


I just wish that Noble in the future will change the Style like Secretlabs and Boulies. The Angle Adjuster on the Omega is the best style all the others are a poor style.  I don't like the look of the Five Star Base and Wheels on the Noble Hero and the style on the other Noble Chairs are worst.


The stitching and quality of the build looks the best on the Noble Hero therefore I'm very tempted to buy one. The comfort and tilting mechanism and lowering the seat on the Omega 9/10. When I eventually buy a Boulies Master Series and the Noble Hero I'll update this post. One last thing, I just don't like the Arm Rest on the Omega in the 2018 version. They are nice and soft, I just prefer more square style. I have the ones with the branding on the Armrest. I would prefer the ones on the Titan in this video and be soft and leathery.

Has anyone had one for a while and experienced the peeling issue with a lot of chairs? Seriously I've had like 3 armchairs made of PU and they all fall apart.

My card did not go through BUT the charge was pending not rejected. That means my money were withheld without actually being transfered. They did not bother cancelling the transcation. So my money were held for a week without me being able to use them. I tried to ask them to cancel and they kept saying it will be done automatically after 10 days and they can do nothing about it. Like i would have no problem not being able to use my money for 10 days. I asked of them a couple of things so my bank could cancel the transcation and they did not even bother answering to my emails. After all this i was even willing to give it another go after my money were returned to me if they were willing to make the promise that this time they will cancel the transaction immidiately if it did not go through.

nOsE0JfmWv0,"Just received my Titan yesterday. I have to say I'm a little disappointed with the quality of some of the parts. When attaching the back-rest to the base, the position of the brackets was off which made it tough when bolting it up. 

The look and feel of the reclining mechanism/plastic shielding is quite appalling. It doesn't conform well to the chair and the right shielding wobbles about.
 
*The Arm-wrests* could also be much improved. They also wiggle about even when locked into position. The lateral adjustments on them are also very clunky. The material is soft enough, but the front of the wrests should have been tapered down at the front- Or there should be forward/back tilt function for them.

*The seat base* on mine has defects in the foam, where it appears they upholstered straight over hard anomalies on the foams surface.

*The Foam itself* is incredibly dense/hard, though this is not a bad thing for me.
I am almost 6ft at 85kg and find the hard foam provides a very nice resistance and support for butt and legs.

*Seat width* is very accommodating and the side bolsters are very mild (almost flat) and there is no feeling of constriction.  
When I initially sat on it, it felt like a rock, but at the same time extremely comfortable.

*Side bolsters* on back-wrest are quite wide. I have about half an inch clearance on both sides of my hips (34 inch waist)

*Side bolsters* on back-wrest also recede nicely as they work their way up the chair, as to give your arms/elbows room to move. 
 
*The Faux leather* feels nice on bare skin, albeit a little bit slippery.

*The Stitching* seems up-to-scratch. Fit and finish of all upholstered parts is good. 
 
*The integrated Lumbar* mechanism is nothing short of fantastic- Perfectly positioned and provides stiff but plush resistance for the Lumbar region. Adjustment range is also decent.

*The Tilt lock* function isn't great, but it works okay. When locking it at any degree of tilt it makes a clunk sound and sometimes you have to weight the chair to get it to lock.

*The Tilt range* isn't very good either. It only offers around 20% of tilt angle, which is less than other chairs I use.
When locked in a Tilt position there is noticeable play and the chair rocks a little (typical of a lot of chairs with this function.

*Reclining function* works well enough- not something I find myself using terribly often.

*Star base* seems adequate and wheels move very nicely over carpet. 
Rocking motion seems good, plenty of resistance for those who need it- also adjustable.

*Gas lift* works fine. In it's lowest position it should accommodate shorter people as short as 5,9. In it's tallest position it should accommodate people as tall as 6,5. 

*Noise* - The Titan is exceptionally quiet and doesn't make a sound when mounting/dismounting, though The Tilt-lock mechanism does make a clunk when locking into position. (Not offensively loud)

*Velour Pillow* - Extremely plush with a premium feel (I could stroke this thing all day) With a very nice foam density. Offers good support for head/upper-neck. 

*Velour Pillow* - mounting area on Backrest is limited. People shorter than 5,11 will struggle to adjust it low enough for optimal support due to the tapering/flanging of backrest. 

Summary: 
I'm quite happy with the Titan. I feel that Secret Labs would have been better off charging a little more for the chair as to allow a more complete/uniform construction. The Quality just seems a little hit & miss. Overall, I'd say the bang per buck is okay. To my knowledge, the hefty shipping cost also comes out of the chairs price, so that is something to factor in.  

+ It's spacious
+ Comfortable
+ Feels nice
+ Looks nice
+ Very ergonomic in design  
+ Has a good range of functions
+ Relatively quiet operation
+ Excellent Lumbar support
+ Extravagant Velour pillow 

- Some finishing parts are poor quality
- Limited range of Tilt angle
- Arm-wrests could be improved
- Some small defects in foam construction
- Noisy Tilt-lock mechanism
- Geometry of mounting arms Seat to Backrest a little off 
- Upper Backrest design restricts range of motion for Velour pillow

nOsE0JfmWv0,"Just received my Titan yesterday. I have to say I'm a little disappointed with the quality of some of the parts. When attaching the back-rest to the base, the position of the brackets was off which made it tough when bolting it up. 

The look and feel of the reclining mechanism/plastic shielding is quite appalling. It doesn't conform well to the chair and the right shielding wobbles about.
 
*The Arm-wrests* could also be much improved. They also wiggle about even when locked into position. The lateral adjustments on them are also very clunky. The material is soft enough, but the front of the wrests should have been tapered down at the front- Or there should be forward/back tilt function for them.

*The seat base* on mine has defects in the foam, where it appears they upholstered straight over hard anomalies on the foams surface.

*The Foam itself* is incredibly dense/hard, though this is not a bad thing for me.
I am almost 6ft at 85kg and find the hard foam provides a very nice resistance and support for butt and legs.

Not too sure why they call it 'Soft' weave, the material feels like very new denim, stiff and coarse. Will probably hold up well in terms of durability, certainly isn't what I personally perceive as 'soft.' Combined with the very firm feel of the foam, it results in a 'sturdy and supportive' as opposed to 'soft and comfy'.'

The stitching is disappointing, often wiggling back and forth, with little loose end to be found (even in the middle of the logo on the back.) You'll notice a lot of little descrepencies in terms of symmetry between the two sides.

The armrests wobble a significant amount, the controls are clunky and have been getting stuck. The guide you'll get does nothing to identify which controls do which, so you'll have to figure out the four available controls, from the three available.

Thankfully there are a fair few controls available for the arms, though personally, once I had compensated for the wonky frame, there was little room left for adjustment. These mechanisms all feel clunky and cheap.

I would ask for a return and replacement due to the wonky frame, especially when you're paying high end prices. Though I really don't want to have to try and deal with their customer service again. Mine didn't turn up on the day I was told it would, 3 times, nor was I informed it would not, it was still sat at their premises whilst they had me waste a day waiting for their 'delivery.'",ParadoxedHope,3,2019-01-25 18:37:17+00:00

iYiybdhJQQA,"So I have officially had mine one week  - soft weave Titan carbon black with blue, 2020. I love the chair. I am a 150lb 6ft male. 

BUILD: The build quality is 9/10, very well made and feel extremely sturdy. Every bolt has a lock washer to help prevent it from backing out. Chair casters are extremely smooth and the chair has a nice weight to it when using it. Feels very solid. You feel good about spending $400 on this chair for this reason. The fabric is premium and keeps your body temperature regulated nicely without leaving hot spots or too cool on your back and butt. The chair also looks SEXY. 

COMFORT: This chair has the most adjust-ability out of any computer chair I've ever owned.  With that being said, it gives you a variety of ergonomic seating positions that aid in long computer session. The armrest adjust in all directions,& the seat can be locked in a reclined position in addition to the backrest. The Lumbar support is nice for keeping your back in a healthy posture and the head pillow sticks out enough to be comfortable for resting your head on. 9/10 for comfort. 

CONS: The seat is firm and has very little give. It is a comfortable supportive firm. What does this mean? My car seat in my vehicle is what I would consider the ""happy"" medium, it is plush and firm at the same time. It is what I was hoping the Secretlabs Titan would be - more on that in a second.The chair's firmness takes some time to get use to, but its more of a perceptive shift if anything. However, I can sit in my Secretlabs Titan without any back, butt, or arm pain for HOURS - like 8 hours plus. I can sit in it all day no problem and feel good getting up. Now - my car seat on the other hand, I can't stand to sit in for more than 4 hours without major back pain which surprised me upon using my Titan the past week now. I would say that although my Titan is much firmer than I anticipated or hoped, it is much more comfortable which I am overall very satisfied with. 

Overall, buy this chair if you are considering. I came from a $120 Homall gaming chair on Amazon, the SecretLabs Titan Softweave chair knocks it out of the park.",9,PilotBuckus,2019-12-23 22:55:17+00:00,venture7o7 perfect with many 8+ hour sitting sessions,PilotBuckus,0,2020-04-25 10:10:23+00:00

I've spent over 10 years racing cars on track and bucket seats style seats are no good for your back. I had  DX racer chair and got rid of it for decent high end office chair and it was a lot better.

I have like 2 inches to spare I'd say.. do you think the titan is too high for me then? (Since even the lowest possible position - 21,3 inches deep and 19,7 or sth inches high - sounds like it might just be a little too high for me..) maybe I shouldnt risk it and just go with the noblechairs hero then but I like the softweave charcoal look and I heard that the secretlab chairs are a little softer than the noblechairs hero..

QMRdwyJI0ys,"I am 5'10"" and I have a Titan.  There are some things about it that are just too damn big.  The lowest the chair goes is still too high.  I'd be more comfortable going 1"" lower.  In that respect, it is hard to understand who at 5'10"" this chair really fits well-- someone with longer legs, but a short torso?

The arm rests are also wide as hell in this thing.  At their closest, they dont quite come in far enough for my elbows to naturally hang at my side.  They need to cut the screw holes in the bottom so these arms can be brought in further.

Overall, I think they did a poor job on allowing this chair to be adjusted better for people at the lower end of their spectrum (5'9"").

QMRdwyJI0ys,HEY REVIEW THE NEW SECRETLAB SOFTWEAVE CHAIRS PLEASE,10,Jurmiah,2018-10-08 17:50:15+00:00,"Not too sure why they call it 'Soft' weave, the material feels like very new denim, stiff and coarse. Will probably hold up well in terms of durability, certainly isn't what I personally perceive as 'soft.' Combined with the very firm feel of the foam, it results in a 'sturdy and supportive' as opposed to 'soft and comfy'.'

The stitching is disappointing, often wiggling back and forth, with little loose end to be found (even in the middle of the logo on the back.) You'll notice a lot of little descrepencies in terms of symmetry between the two sides.

The armrests wobble a significant amount, the controls are clunky and have been getting stuck. The guide you'll get does nothing to identify which controls do which, so you'll have to figure out the four available controls, from the three available.

Thankfully there are a fair few controls available for the arms, though personally, once I had compensated for the wonky frame, there was little room left for adjustment. These mechanisms all feel clunky and cheap.

I would ask for a return and replacement due to the wonky frame, especially when you're paying high end prices. Though I really don't want to have to try and deal with their customer service again. Mine didn't turn up on the day I was told it would, 3 times, nor was I informed it would not, it was still sat at their premises whilst they had me waste a day waiting for their 'delivery.'",ParadoxedHope,4,2019-01-25 18:33:32+00:00

QMRdwyJI0ys,"Hi, great reviews!  Wondering if you could provide me a stat on the Titan.  At the lowest seat height setting, can you sit down on the Titan and give me a height measurement from the ground to the top surface of the seat?  The added weight should cause some cushion and piston compression.  I have a low integrated keyboard tray so finding the right size chair is a challenge.  I want the Titan's large size but the 19.5"" min seat height is borderline for me.  But if there's a good 1 - 2"" compression, then that would be perfect.

The Omega's maximum weight capacity is 240 lbs., so it will hold you. The Omega's recommended weight capacity is 175lbs., but when I reviewed it I felt like it could easily hold more than that. You could also always go with a Titan, see how the lumbar support works for you, and if it doesn't work out as is, you can buy the lumbar support pillow that comes with the Omega, or use a third-party lumbar support cushion.",Tech Guided,0,2018-08-08 16:44:31+00:00

QMRdwyJI0ys,"Thank you for this video. Just received my Titan yesterday and have to say that it is very comfortable. Only downside is that the seat pan is quite deep, which makes the front of my upper legs hurt a bit when sitting high in the chair and that the arm rests differ 0.5cm in height. Otherwise it is a great fit for me. I'm 1,85M tall and weigh around 90KG. 

I think the chair works best if the armrests are slightly lower than the desk, otherwise your shoulders feel pushed up. Working with the rests all the way down is always possible as well, if you don't have RSI :)",1,EduardBoon,2018-07-06 23:00:15+00:00,Thnx i fall in Both chair size range.

We've noted on the feedback with regard to the backrest and seatbase alignment and we're actively working on improving this process. Meanwhile, should you be facing issues aligning them, we'd highly recommend you bring a family member or friend to help you if possible:

Person A:
1. Push down and align the right side of the backrest with the corresponding recline arm.

Person B:
1. Insert the M8 fasteners‚Äîtake note not to tighten it all the way; each should go in smoothly if the fastener is inserted straight and correctly.
2. Ensure that the backrest is secured in place.

3kFexYEBgJA,"Just received and assembled my 2020 Titan I ordered a month or so ago.  I didn‚Äôt have any problems assembling, and noticed a few new additions on my chair in comparison to the video.  To me, this illustrates Secretlab is listening and wants to maintain the best gaming chair on the planet.  This also reaffirms my purchase decision.  Anyhow, here are some differences I noticed:  

- Instruction sheet was updated, which was great.
- Allen wrench was included, but also included is a plastic handle and a bit with Phillips on one side and the Allen wrench size on the other.  Just flip that puppy around and only one tool necessary for complete assembly.
-The seat-back bolt covers are now magnetic and snap right in place.  Screws are no longer necessary or included.
-The right side of the seat-back now has a metal guide bracket to help guide into the bracket on the seat bottom.  It slides right in so you can loosely set the bolts while working on the left side.  The left side is a little awkward to line up, but not difficult after a second to learn the movement pattern.

The best part is the end of the video where the guy is just chilling after assembly.  This was me 100.  This chair is awesome!",1,JH Studios,2020-09-23 16:38:15+00:00,"Also just received and assembled my 2020 Omega and can confirm these changes have been included for the Omega as well. Took me no more than 30 minutes to full assemble, and that's including taking breaks to admire how gorgeous each part of the chair is. A few things I can add that I noticed about the whole package:

- There are ample warnings not to touch the recliner handle until the backrest is on. Even so, a lock screw is in place so it won't move until removed. Very smart and considerate.
- The most difficult part for me in aligning the backrest was actually not cross-threading the screws. However, getting it aligned was really easy on my own, using my bed to help prop up the backrest.
- The instruction sheet is MASSIVE. There shouldn't be any issues for people with far-sightedness.

However, we advise against doing so as the armrests play a crucial role in supporting your wrists and elbows, which in turn helps take the strain off your neck and shoulders.

Our full-metal 4D armrests are fully adjustable in four different directions:
1. Up/down
2. Front/back
3. Sideways 
4. Diagonally 

We recommend that you try adjusting them to a position that best suits your preference and needs first. You can also check out their exact dimensions right here: https://secretlab.co/pages/resources We hope this helps!",Secretlab,0,2020-09-11 08:12:58+00:00

3kFexYEBgJA,"I just assembled my chair yesterday and there are two things not mentioned in this video or on the directions mat that came with my 2020 Titan.


1. The backrest side covers no longer use screws. I looked around my box for a good 5 minutes for them only to then notice it appears they are now attached via magnets. They magnets work great but it would have been nice to have seen that mentioned in the directions.
2. There is a red screw that must be remove before the recline lever can be used which is also not mentioned anywhere in the directions. I fully assembled my chair and actually thought mine was broken when the recline did not want to engage. I got up and look at the side and then saw a little red sticker saying something along the lines of ""do NOT remove screw until seat and backrest are attached"". Once the screw was removed, it works great. I assumed this was put in place as an additional measure to make sure people did not pull the lever until the seat as assembled since there was at least 3 other warnings not to touch it on the bags.


Besides those two quirks, assembly was pretty uneventful and I was able to finish up in about 25-30 after unboxing.",0,Eric Schenk,2020-04-08 12:27:01+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

I like that lumbar pillow but from all the reviews I've seen (and I've seen like.. at least 7 different, in depth ones) everyone says that the integrated lumbar pillow is so good in the TITAN and TITAN XL because you don't have this freely moving pillow like the Omega has, what has been your experience with it? Would you have rather had the Lumbar Pillow built in and adjustable? Do you still use the Lumbar pillow? If so, do you find yourself frequently adjusting it or even removing it sometimes altogether? That's another thing one of the reviewers said, was that they just got rid of the lumbar pillow altogether cause it was a bit of a hassle. 

For me I see it this way... I think adjustable integration of it is so much more convenient, cleaner-looking, and just better because you get to decide just how much you want it poking into your back (supporting lol not poking) or how much you don't and you never have to worry about it getting dirty.

Instead I unscrewed the right side and then aligned the moveable left side, put in some screws on the left, then adjusted the right back into position, and put the screws in there. It took me a total of ten minutes to get the backrest in. However, if I had screwed the right side tight first, I would have probably thrown the chair out the window (if I could have lifted it).

3kFexYEBgJA,My boyfriends chair just came in the mail today while I was home. I decided i'd put it together while he was at work. It took me 30 minutes to put it together by myself. Most of the time was unwrapping it and reviewing this video section by section. I didnt bother with the paper instructions because I do better with visual examples. I love putting things together plus can change my own tires so I know very well you dont tighten one bolt and move on to the next. Get the screws in by hand but dont tighten them. Once all are in place and feel like its set properly without force then tighten but make sure to switch by going across from each one like an X formation. You may not have to do an X but my father always told be its just best to do it that way so I always do. So when I got to the point of tightening I did the bottom right side of the back of the chair then changes to the top left on the other side and so on. Take your time and be patient. I know my boyfriend has no patients and get anxious so I felt I'd be kind and save him the stress. Im tempted to buy one for myself now after sitting in the finished product.

3kFexYEBgJA,"For those having difficulty aligning the backrest with the screw holes, be sure to attach the right hand side of the chair first (the side with the adjustment lever). Also, leave the two screws on that side a little extra-loose, to give you more movement while aligning the left side. The left side bracket is free-moving, so it's a matter of moving BOTH the seat back AND the bracket until they align. Yes, it's a little awkward, but if you still have trouble, try having someone help support the seat back while you align the holes. I had very little trouble getting the backrest attached, so I hope this helps. 



Also, for those asking about how to incrementally lock the ""rocking"" function of the chair, you can't. And that's by design. You don't lock it, you adjust the tension of the rocking feature by way of the rotating knob on the bottom of the chair, until it feels right. That feature is either the ""locked"" position (upright) or the ""unlocked"" position (where you can rock back according to the tension you've set via the knob). Just play around with the tension on the rocking mechanism, along with the reclining positions of the backrest to achieve your desired seat orientation.",60,ViveNate,2019-09-10 00:23:19+00:00,"@helix19667 Great to hear, and glad to be of help!",ViveNate,0,2020-05-29 00:18:37+00:00

If you like the seat to really just fit you then get the omega. If not then get the titan. The softweave on it is not itchy at all. Although the chair kinda hurts my butt if I sit for a long time. The chair is kind of hard basically lol. It is still comfortable and the closest thing I can compare the seat to is memory foam. The two pillows you get are quite nice but the lower one can become quite a hassle at times because its nit attached to the chair but at time u wont even notice if u sit on it for a while.

CYGYb3bnc0M,"<-- Ordered a titan. with the soft weave option. I'm curious as to how lighter white stains might show on the fabric. Will post back once I've experience with this chair. For science. :D TBH. I was torn between the Omega and the Titan. I wanted the omega for the other color option on the softweave, as I'm not too fond of the cookies n cream's appearance, but I decided to go with the titan because, rather than giving you a lumbar pillow, they have a built in adjustable lumber support which is a higher end feature in office chairs and what not.  Some cars and lazyboy chairs even have adjustable lumber support. I'm not quite rich enough for the Nappa Leather model, and didn't want PuLeather as it doesnt have the best longevity and more importantly, breathability, which the soft weave should solve.

That said, I'm not sure if it was the chair or my previous posture but there was a pretty painful week long acclimation period. Now that I'm used to the chair however, I would not go back. The softweave is pretty cat resistant. I do have an extra pillow on top for longer gaming sessions (which may have contributed to some of the acclimation discomfort), because I'm not one that has much for ""natural"" cushioning. The appearance has grown on me, but I'd still have preferred a more simple black appearance. I also ordered one for my father and he certainly appreciates the lumbar support. 
The reclining feature is pretty bitchin. Unlike my old chair which did not recline, I can fall asleep in this bad boy and not suffer a sore neck the following day. Because it's the winter, I can't really comment on the breathability vs a leather or pleather seat, however, logically I'm sure there will be a benefit in the summer months. Not sure what else I can say. Cheers.",truth_decay,4,2018-12-28 12:52:29+00:00

I wanted to update you all on some things with this chair.  Great chair BUT things have taken a slight down turn and while it is nothing I am totally in up in arms about I‚Äôm going to post them so you know what I have seen and experienced.  


I released a second video on this https://youtu.be/THR7LdF4CpM

My 2020 Titan has developed a few issues so far.¬†

The first is it started to squeak badly on lean back, man it was terrible and driving me nuts I contacted Secret Lab and they sent a really helpful sheet showing where to add a little penetrating lubricant and it resolved it and chair is silent again.  

However this is not it all sorted, it seems to have also developed a strange wobble as I lean back, it‚Äôs like there is a slight bump in the leaning mech, however I don‚Äôt think it is there and have worked out I think it‚Äôs the piston shaft  moving as my weight shifts as I lean back and you can feel it through the base pad.  

I contacted Secret Lab on this as well and they sent a response about the piston not being aligned and is normal and nothing to be concerned with. Tbh I‚Äôm not 100% happy with either that answer or the actual issue, for a premium chair I would expect the lean to be silky smooth.   

Im still talking to them at this stage.¬†

Edit September 2019 Update.¬†

Further to the above the wobble remained, I have 100% narrowed it down too the piston shaft wobbling as the weight changed as I lean back, this is at its worst when the chair is fully extended, its clear to see when you lean and the piston rocks.¬†

Sadly a 3rd issues have arisen in that the foam on the front of the seat base appears to have come loose and dropped, its seems there is a front patch of foam along the front thats glued on and this glue has come loose on the RH side. I have a very noticeable bump now as the foam drops, I can man handle it into place but it just moved again as soon as I sit on it.¬†

They replaced my seat pad for the loose foam, my piston and the base tilt mech a few weeks ago. 

Interestingly the new base tilt mech started to squeak in just a few days after fitting just like the first one but some lube delt with that.  

So that‚Äôs 2 with the same issues !!!  

The old piston was just totally knackered it was shocking once it removed it. Still don‚Äôt know how it got this bad so quickly and the new one has resolved my issue with the movement, the question is for how long right now.

I LOVE the chair but to be honest at this price the issues are disappointing.   I‚Äôm going to do a video on this at some point soon and they may not like it but my current thoughts are that the chairs are very well designed but a little fragile.  Perhaps the high price tag is to offset the cost of repairs.  

Would I buy another one ? 

Absolutely yes, I want the dark night edition soo badly.",Mad's Tech,2,2019-10-27 17:40:22+00:00

My card did not go through BUT the charge was pending not rejected. That means my money were withheld without actually being transfered. They did not bother cancelling the transcation. So my money were held for a week without me being able to use them. I tried to ask them to cancel and they kept saying it will be done automatically after 10 days and they can do nothing about it. Like i would have no problem not being able to use my money for 10 days. I asked of them a couple of things so my bank could cancel the transcation and they did not even bother answering to my emails. After all this i was even willing to give it another go after my money were returned to me if they were willing to make the promise that this time they will cancel the transaction immidiately if it did not go through. But they did not even answer on those email. It was too much for them to make a simple promise to save a bad customer impression.
I would comment on the product but thanks to their shit customer support i was never able to buy one. Go buy another chair, this thing is not even worth it.",1,k oikonomou,2017-10-18 21:26:43+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

Also, if you visit the Vertagear website, you can chat live with an employee and ask them any questions you have. They have incredible customer service. When I got my chair, it had a faulty raise/lower mechanism, which was just one part. The chair was functional, but I couldn't lean back in it. They sent me and ENTIRE new bottom chassis, wheels, 5 star base, compression arm and everything. I now have loads of backup parts! 
Also, if you do go with the Vertagear chair, upgrade to the 4D armrests, it's TOTALLY worth it, also, the bigger wheels don't make much of a difference, but are worth the extra money just to have a set of backups. I love my SL2000, and as someone who live with pain every day, it's the most comfortable chair I've ever owned.

I do tend to sit with my legs spread wide---which I guess isn't the right way to sit---but when I was reviewing the Omega and DXRacer F-Series the raised sides made it uncomfortable to sit with my legs in a wider position (because they would rest on the raised sides.) The Titan does have slightly raised sides but they aren't nearly as pronounced as the Omega & F-Series and I think there are a few other racing-style chairs out there that offer something similar.

It is sturdy, the armrests are premium quiality as well as the softweave, the bottum and the tilt function. The softweave actually feel a lot less rough than I would have imagined and the chair looks really good. 
But this is by no means an armchair. The build is definitely better than cheaper chairs but you don't just dump into the chair. it is not soft. It is a rough build with coating, if that makes any sense. The backpillow if what provides you with comfort and relaxation. My stomach is in a better position in this chair though. Sometimes I could have wished that the sitting piece was further out to offer more support to my legs (eventhough I'm 173 cms) but tilting the chair just a tiny bit seems to offer the support I need. I don't think there's no such thing as the perfect chair and all chais takes some getting used to. And none of the other gaming chairs have a more armchair like build, so maybe that critique is unjust. Then you could by a proper work ""boss"" chair but that won't probably have the tilting functionality and risk getting too soft for your posture in the long run maybe?

If you want a roomier chair, go with the Titan. If you want a chair that fits you a bit more snug, go with the Omega.

Also, note that the lumbar support on the Omega and Titan are different. The Omega comes with a pillow---which is pretty good in terms of lumbar support pillows---and the Titan comes with built-in adjustable lumbar support. I really like the Titan's built-in lumbar support because I can dial it back a bit.

Ultimately, both chairs are good options and I think either would work for you. It will just come down to how you want the chair to fit and what lumbar support style you'd prefer.",Tech Guided,0,2018-07-02 20:13:58+00:00

Although, I have been sitting in the Titan for a few months now, and now that I'm not trying to think about every aspect of sitting in it (for the review), I don't notice the lumbar support placement as much anymore.

My gut says that it would probably be more than fine for you, but it really depends on how important the placement of the lumbar support is to you. I know you can purchase the same lumbar pillow that comes on the Omega separately as well. So, worst case scenario, you could always add their pillow (or a third party option) later. Obviously, not an ideal way to approach it, but if you did go with the Titan and you didn't like where the lumbar support hit you (but you liked the rest of the chair), that would be one way to fix it.",Tech Guided,4,2018-06-16 17:58:13+00:00

Most of them being made in the same factory matters because a lot of these chairs do indeed break over time, which is worrisome. All the really solid highly rated stuff is dumb expensive (Steelcase, Herman Miller, etc) and the cheap stuff has either mixed or fake reviews. The Titan *definitely* seems like the best out of all the gaming chairs, though!

Definitely try out a Steelcase, I'd love to watch. :) There's also the Autonomous Ergochair2, which attempts to bring the Steelcase/Herman Miller experience at a lower price... The Ergochair2 is actually cheaper than the Titan.

So there is a slight fillet on the seat base, but that's nothing harsh. The arm rests are quite wide (the actual pillar for them) so while the top is adjustable it sounds like it would be the pillar that would be on your legs. But, I don't think that would be an issue. The gap between the pillars is 25in (64cm), and on the Titan XL is 27in (69cm)

I have a problem with the sciatic nerve and I cannot let the wings (sides) of the seat to push the sides of my legs or I cannot use the chair. Is the regular Titan squeezing the sides of the legs when you seat like a seat of a sport car for instance or is if kind of flat despite the wings on the seatbase? 
That was my only reason of thinking about the XL model because the seatbase is 5,5cm larger.

I find the padding soft but supportive. It's a good chair, and very nice looking, but I do wonder if I should have just spent 100-150 at staples. I still get some pain sometimes, but it's way better. My table is slightly lower than it should be, and monitor isnt placed right; so if I fix that I might be able to improve things further.

Issue with my current chair is the padding in the seat just feels like its lost most of its support and 2-3 hour gaming sessions can leave me feeling a bit sore.

Bsvkuhb2FKk,Thank you for a very nice review and for being specific while differentiating your perspectives.  Many reviewers only sit in high dollar chairs and forget that when they try to convey the product details to their audience.  With that said I'm a big guy and there aren't that many chairs that are comfortable to me so I like to hear from people who are using the units I'm considering.  At this point I believe that the Titan is at the top of my list followed by the PL6000.  I really wish that both of them had a variant with a flat seat cushion and a wingless backrest.,1,The Outlier,2018-05-01 23:06:09+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

Bsvkuhb2FKk,"Yeah the feel of these are subjetive for sure. I got the 2018 Omega chair from Secretlab and I simply feel the cushion is too firm. I can literally get sore on my butt after many hours in it. I am not sure if the Titan would be different for me, but alas this is the risk of buying a chair online. Everyone else seems to love it judging by the reviews.

Also as far as an all black chair goes, Maxnomic makes one that looks suspeciously a lot like the Titan called Commander :)

I did a lot of research myself before buying, and several brands of chairs do look very similar, I've also had the thought that these seems to be made from just a handful of suppliers, like you said. I read that the Maxnomic ones are cold foam, somewhat firm like the secretlab, I think they'd feel exactly like a secretlab chair.

To me it feels very similar to the Titan (which I love). So, the Titan might not be for you, then. Probably the same level of firmness between the two.

Yep, those look pretty similar. The base is different and the side plates look different as well.


But, I think that happens a lot on these racing-style chairs and I've been holding off on mentioning it until I get through more reviews. In reality, there are likely only a handful of chair manufacturers (all probably in China) and the companies that sell these chairs go through those manufacturers.

And, then the original manufacturer probably has customization options so that these companies can sell their own version of the chair (different color schemes, cover material, cushion material, arm rests, lumbar options, bases, casters, etc.)

It will be interesting to see how many of these chairs are actually the same. I know people have told me before that they've gotten a knock-off DXRacer, but I'm wondering if some of these cheaper chairs that look like the big brands aren't, in fact, the same exact chair, just being sold by a lesser-known brand.

And, yep! I don't watch Twitch a lot, but when I do, Doc is who I watch the most. He's the best.",Tech Guided,1,2018-04-04 22:55:13+00:00

you do have to assemble the chair yourself, my arm rests don't wobble but it's possible some people don't do as good a job putting it together. 

over all i give this chair a 5/5 especially given the price point and that i find it more comfortable than numerous chairs that cost over 2 grand.",onemadhungrynomad,0,2018-07-20 01:18:29+00:00

I hear the armrests wobble a bit on the SL chairs?",7,J D,2018-03-13 12:35:15+00:00,"Thanks for the heads up on arm rest comfort. Definitely something I will start paying more attention to in future chair reviews.

The Titan's arm rests are comfortable I'd say. I can't say that there's anything special about their comfort level, though, as I think most of these style chairs arm rests are made out of the same material. But, they're wider than most other arm rests I've seen. And a lot of chairs' arm rests have a sort of groove in the middle of them, which might not be great for everyone, as the groove might not properly fit everyone's arms. The Titan's arm rests have a flatter surface (with a very slight groove).

The arm rests do wobble a bit. Not at the base/support of the arm rest, though, but at the arm rests themselves. And, that I think is due to how many different directions the arm rest can be adjusted (side-to-side, forwards & backwards, and angled).

The slight wobble isn't something that really bothers me, but I might not use the arm rests as much as you or others do.",Tech Guided,9,2018-03-13 20:49:23+00:00

Titan seems like a premium product. I was reading somewhere the wheels are plastic but i don't think they are, or at least, not any more. It feels like stiff rubber to me. oh and the seat is not hard at all, perfect under the butt from day one. So i'm very pleased with my purchase, despite the shipping issues.

Even after all the badluck, i gave secretlab a 5-star, because they almost sended me a new chair in parts... so hand down to there support and team! how is your chair doing? will you make an updated video soon? ;) people need real reviews like yours. Cheers!",Halogie,0,2018-12-08 01:01:32+00:00

I do wish that I had a second neck pillow that was thicker because if you want to lean your head back it is a little uncomfortable with how far you have to tilt your head back. However, that is a small issue. There is no wear and tear, there's no damage done in anyway and it has been fully used. No scratches from my dog either even though he sits on it a lot. I do recommend something. Have a friend lean back as far as they can and then have them pull the lever to make them go flat, it is HILARIOUS every time.",Ditharian Gaming,0,2018-10-28 16:58:34+00:00

My card did not go through BUT the charge was pending not rejected. That means my money were withheld without actually being transfered. They did not bother cancelling the transcation. So my money were held for a week without me being able to use them. I tried to ask them to cancel and they kept saying it will be done automatically after 10 days and they can do nothing about it. Like i would have no problem not being able to use my money for 10 days. I asked of them a couple of things so my bank could cancel the transcation and they did not even bother answering to my emails. After all this i was even willing to give it another go after my money were returned to me if they were willing to make the promise that this time they will cancel the transaction immidiately if it did not go through. But they did not even answer on those email. It was too much for them to make a simple promise to save a bad customer impression.
I would comment on the product but thanks to their shit customer support i was never able to buy one.

Most welcome! 
If your looking for a chair specifically for strict  posture benifits i don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd recommend the Titan chair. It is nice caters to those who care about good posture, but if you already have some issues because of long term bad posture. I‚Äôd say then yea look towards another chair specifically for supporting you. 
I‚Äôd just say when looking for them, cuz of the Titan chair! See if they male chairs for people who are 6‚Äô-6‚Äô5‚Äô‚Äô. 
I never thought of chairs like that until I found Titan & that was the big selling thing for me. 

I definitely see now why it‚Äôs good to get a chair that is aimed for taller people üòä

Hey! Glad you liked it! 
I think I know what your asking about the legs, I would say it probably could use a bit more support under the legs when I think about then couple of times I‚Äôve done 24 your streams (2 or 3) 
I just finished a 7 hour stream and still completely comfortable! 
1 year later, no real wear & tear. I do recall one incident where a screw fell out under the chair, idk from over time if unscrewed itself or if I didn‚Äôt screw it tight enough. But it went back in fine. That was like 2 months ago really. 
I still think it‚Äôs great & love it, I work a desk job & between the full time job & my streams I‚Äôm always sitting down. I much prefer the Titan over my chairs at work. 
The seat itself is not too much cushion, it‚Äôs more of a good firm foam so it feels like your sitting in an actual desk chair & not a couch cushion chair.

The lumbar support, probably could be a bit better. It‚Äôs there, it works. This is my first real chair with lumbar support, you can feel the difference when it‚Äôs full rolled on & off. 
I haven‚Äôt experienced any lower back pain. Only discomfort I ever recall with the chair, which might be me, sometimes my elbows hurt on the arm rest after long periods of time, but I think for some reason it might be me pushing my elbow into the chair because of my gaming, I play FSP & survival horror with friends, so I can be very into a game. 
The arm rest aren‚Äôt really padded, but they are not uncomfortable. Like I said. Only after long hours I‚Äôve noticed that I start to get pain. 
And I‚Äôve felt sore after my 24 hour streams but who probably wouldn‚Äôt? 
The chair I think for what I paid ($350 I think, around their) totally worth the price in my opinion.

And you 95kg is 209 lbs, im just under 200.
I think the weight limit is around 300 lbs, so you should be fine w/ your weight & your height is definatly on the Titan side of the Secret Labs Chair not the Omega
You can also check out their website they talk more about weight & height also of course go more in depth about the chair ;)

Hey dude, I have another question if you don't mind. 

One of my main complaints I have right now with my DxRacer is that my right arm (mouse arm) gets really sore after a while. I'm almost as tall as you (6'1"" last time I measured, which was 2 years ago, so prolly somewhere between 6'1"" - 6'3""cm tall right now). 

So my question is: 
Did you have a similar issue as me with your arms getting sore when you were using your older chair? Since I think my issue is caused by the chair being to low (chair is build for 5'8"" maximum) and your older chair had a broken height adjustment, right? So did you feel any discomfort in your arms whilst using the older chair whilst gaming when it was lower than normal? If yes, did this chair solve the issue?",brobrobrro,0,2018-01-02 04:00:03+00:00

It‚Äôs cushion is more like a padding so it‚Äôs firm & not a sink  cushion. And from what I hear from others that‚Äôs what you would want in a chair. The real pillow cushions sink over time & your butt is closer and closer to just sitting on the metal parts of the chair.

My card did not go through BUT the charge was pending not rejected. That means my money were withheld without actually being transfered. They did not bother cancelling the transcation. So my money were held for a week without me being able to use them. I tried to ask them to cancel and they kept saying it will be done automatically after 10 days and they can do nothing about it. Like i would have no problem not being able to use my money for 10 days. I asked of them a couple of things so my bank could cancel the transcation and they did not even bother answering to my emails. After all this i was even willing to give it another go after my money were returned to me if they were willing to make the promise that this time they will cancel the transaction immidiately if it did not go through. But they did not even answer on those email. It was too much for them to make a simple promise to save a bad customer impression.

5nB0_sSWwEs,"Hey I have a few questions. I just received my Titan, and as much as I love it, I have noticed a few oddities. When I slowly rock the chair seems to ever so slightly drop just a tiny bit, and then raise when going back to the regular position. Or at least this is what I think is happening. Also Is the piston only supposed to use 2 of the 3 section of the cover thing? The middle part never extends fully.",0,Phill,2017-08-25 00:23:40+00:00,"Our engineering team has read the description of your issue and they have investigated and understood the slight bump which you are referring to. They have informed that this slight bump that you are experiencing is actually the movement shift between the hydraulics piston and the tilt mechanism. 

At the connecting joint when the hydraulics piston is inserted into the tilt mechanism, there is a small room of free play at the connecting joints and this is by design to prevent any excessive tension on the tilt mechanism through usage over time. However please be assured this is very normal across our chair and will not compromise the safety and quality of our chairs! :)

We hope the above helps explains and clears up any concern you may have. As usual please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any queries in future thank you :)",Phill,1,2017-08-26 16:11:12+00:00

The cover for the piston has 3 slots so i thought it would extend that tall not that i need it. It only uses two of them but that's what is intended.  

I don't know how to really explain the rocking issue as it doesn't actully lower the chair.  Its more like i feel a slight bump in the piston as i rock slowly. Sometimes it happend every time i rock and other times it takes a few back and forths. Its unnoticable if going at a quicker speed. No idea what's happening there",Phill,0,2017-08-25 05:07:17+00:00

No rips or tearing of the leather around the back rest area, but I've noticed a small leather tear near the seat area, somewhere in between the thigh rest area. Probably due to compression thus it kind of wear off. But I don't see it on anywhere else, could be my own mistake of accidentally scratching the leather.

Its adjusted by the lever underneath the seat on your right. Just have to pull it. If it doesn't work maybe you received a faulty hydraulic cylinder. Well, do contact Secretlab and see what they can do for you!",The Let's Play Channel,0,2016-08-10 07:25:24+00:00

h6ikup8Rc28,There is an option to freely recline with the lever under the chair on the left. I had the same issue when I first assembled my titan chair.

X5pgkPOyp8U,"I've just recieved a Titan and on day 2 now at the end of a 12hr shift my legs are killing me. My previously chair was fine but it's over 10 years old an needs replacing but the base and overall synchro tilt is far more comfortable, unfortunately can't get them anymore. From all the reviews I've seen people say they get used to it, but seeing it in person I think that's less likely. For chair ergonomics, if you google it, the chair base should be flat and pressure shouldn't be on the legs behind the knees. Designing an office chair around a car seat is silly as they perform different functions and for your body to be in a similar position to when you drive you would be practically sitting on the floor. The back support is amazing however, pretty surprising to be honest. There's some plastic parts like the wheels but they function surprisingly well. It did come with 2 defects one being a very rusty bolt and the other the arm latch fell off that will need replacing. I can tell they've put a lot of thought and effort into the chair but there's too many positive reviews, it feels artificial. Is it really that good? Is harder better? Will I really get used to it? Do they know something the internet doesn't know about ergonomics or is the native tilt in the seat not that bad after a bit? I'm trying to work out wether to return or not because there's very few quality chairs anymore. There is the ergo miller logitech chair but that's many times more expensive and is it even better, sounds like more hype than substance.",0,Commander ZiN,2020-07-23 12:42:36+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

I‚Äôll have to check that out. If it‚Äôs about people maybe sweating on the chair, I could see why that could maybe lead to potential peeling. And or if people are using the care products cuz some people could maybe have an allergic reaction to those products. I think it might be more towards them playing it safe than it leading to any damage to the chair or potential harmful to a user. But I‚Äôll have to look over that.

They do have ads on the page about what the chair is made of, its the cold cure foam that they use in the seats. 
I have not talked to Secret Labs directly in a while, I may reach out to them about something & I will review their warranty/return process and if something seems weird/funny/shady, ill ask some questions on it for feed back for us.

X5pgkPOyp8U,"I sit in mine crosslegged. Don't ask me why. I've been doing that since I was a kid and neither my dad, nor any teacher (back way back when) has ever whipped me out of the habit. For when I do sit like a normal person I use a memory foam foot rest. Crue is spot on about the monitor and desk being as important as the chair itself. 

I cannot recommend enough having a monitor arm over a monitor stand. The flexibility it offers you solves most issues that a fixed monitor presents.
Desks are often more of a challenge and adjustable desks can set you back. This is why i suggest a decent foot rest, especially the ones you can turn upside down and use as feet rockers. 

This last year has taught me that for every dollar (pound, yen, whatever) you spend on your PC, you should think about setting aside at least another half dollar for your body - i.e. The desk, the monitor, foot rest, wrist rests or pads. The most important part of your setup should always be YOU. An extra 5% of FPS won't help with back pain, or knee pain. Spending some of that budget on yourself will go a long way to maintaining the most valuable thing you have, your health and the overall experience will be so much nicer. Good luck, peace out and happy sitting. :)",1,Mr Thornton,2020-04-04 16:47:06+00:00,Amazing comment dude! And 100% agree w/ everything you said :),Crue Steele,0,2020-04-04 20:42:57+00:00

I've been looking for a decent chair since i spend hours on my pc coding + gaming and might finally pull the trigger on secretlab. 
Just wanted to ask, since i fall in the range of both Titan & Omega, is having an integrated lumbar support worth the extra $?",2,Mujibul Islam Dipto,2020-02-09 22:02:37+00:00,"@Mujibul Islam Dipto my pleasure :D
lmao, i do get asked that a lot, and it doesnt feel like concrete. 
If you go to their site and look under Omega/Titan, they tell you the material its made of. 
Its very firm, but not in an uncomfortable way. I have heard some people say it is to firm for their taste. 
But typically for chair you want it to be more firm than cushion. 
Chairs that have a lot of cushion flatten over time, lose their shape, and some cases you end up sitting on the metal plate at the end",Crue Steele,1,2020-02-09 23:27:29+00:00

For the extra $30 I'd say its more you're investing in better back/head coverage. The Lumbar support is nice, but i wouldnt say its the deal maker for Titan, its defiantly the big solid back in my opinion and the lumbar is just bonus perk.
If you do get the Omega they do sell lumbar pillows separately , just an FYI! :D",Crue Steele,1,2020-02-09 22:42:25+00:00
X5pgkPOyp8U,"I finally pulled the trigger after a couple of years of wanting one, figured I'd share here too.  The seat is definitely stiff, and it can give you some iron booty, but the build quality absolutely gives that premium feel to it.  The back is comfortable, and all the positions you can put it in is awesome.  I've only had it for about a week or two at this point and the seat is pretty stiff.  It still feels hard to sit down on it, as there's definitely no squish to it, but over-all it's a much more comfortable sitting position.  I kinda miss my gel office seat on the ass, but the posture and the multiple positions you can throw it in is so much better on the back.",0,Mick H,2020-02-06 05:36:44+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

Now my only issue is having to wait I'm really, really torn between the Dark Knight or the Charcoal and Blue Soft Weave. I know being a fat old bastard the Soft Weave will be more comfortable but I'm also worried about longevity and staining. The Dark Knight however is just fucking awesome, pardon my french.

But guitar. Well actually you could just remove the arms now that I‚Äôm thinking. 
It might be fine then. 
It‚Äôs just the arms that are in your way, so maybe not even put them on if you get it. Or just remove them when you want to play. 
However I just checked. Their Allen wrench screws that hold it. 3 of them on each arm. So just consider it may be a bit involved. Could probably just hand tighten them if your going to be using the arms on & off",Crue Steele,1,2019-08-27 16:53:44+00:00

If you check out the Titans specifics, it says the width of the seat base is 22 inches. Honestly If I was your, i'd sit down and measure real quick how wide you would be. If your 22 or less, id say go for it. and when it comes in, before assembling, just take the chair out, put it on a couch or the floor, sit on it real quick to see how you measure up. 
My chair, the arm wrests when i extend them all the way out, they go to the edge of the seat. So if your 22 or under that, and if it comes in and you test it, and your sitting okay in it. Go ahead & fully assemble it, cuz for mine, your arm wrests should not be in the way of you when you go to sit.
In the pics too you can also see how the armrests are for the 2020, they shouldnt be blocking you if you go to sit in it.

If you are that figure, please tell me what to do.

Much appreciated for doing this video, the rest of the reviews are all corporate schills whose opinions are bought and paid for by oligarchs.

X5pgkPOyp8U,"Best review on this chair i¬¥ve seen so far( AND I HAVE SEEN A LOT)! You really go indept on the smaller details! watched the other 2 reviews to but this one nailed it for me.. to bad they wouldn't sponser you since it's you that sold it to me hahahaha. anyway still can't decide between the dark knight , the stark G.O.T or the charcoil blue soft weave. 1 question...? do you find yourself using the lumbar support ofthen?",8,Mick Den Dulk,2019-08-14 01:33:05+00:00,"@Crue Steele hey i promised when i got the chair i would get back at you, i got it last thursday (my girlfriend got me one ass a surprise, im a lucky man)  so i have had some days to test it.

First off i noticed was the quality, it really looks and feels like a 400‚Ç¨ chair. The stiching and all looks great! 

I've heard a lot off ""complains"" about the stiff feeling off the seat but i find it verry compfy although my other gamechair felt way more stiff so for my butt this feels like a vacation hahaha.

I am 180cm/ 6ft
77kg/ 154 pound
So i have an average high and wheight and even still i have a lot off wiggle space when i sit in the chair. Wich i like a lot. 

Only small negative is that i would have liked the armpads to go 1 inch lower. but this is a verry personal one because of my  anatomy, i am not verry tall but i have long arms (like eventhough i am 180cm from my left hand to my right hand is 192cm, i have arms like a gorillaü§£ü§£ü§£üòÇ).

The arm pads itself are great and feel comfy, i find it quite usefull that they are so adjustable, same goes for the lumbar support! But if i was secretlab i would have made it so that you could buy modkits with different types of armpads like for example softer ones or longer or smaller ones. And that you could easily click them on. Maybe a though for the 2021 editionü§î

Anyone who works in an office area who wants a nice stylish chair would be laughed at with that blue. Its just to much of a niche color .It wouldn't even match my gaming setup. 
I told them after they said they weren't planning on at that time making anymore variations of the software. That they should make a neutral color softweave fabric like  all black /charcoal would be beneficial to the companies softweave brand due to the widespread of appeal of black being good for office,gaming and just about anywhere and that competitors aren't making fabric options. 
I laid out like 2 pages of reasoning why it would be good 
Idea for a neutral black scheme.
They thanked me and told me they would tell them.
  Now I'm sure others complained and ask as well. But it just seemed pretty coincidental that not to long after i suggested they did it. And I'm so glad I waited. I was gonna buy that charcoal blue and let a black permanent marker do it's magic lol but I sure didn't want to shell out 300 and make the chair look worse.
Its pretty sweet that a company actually  listen to its potential customers.

AWgR4azFwB0,"NOTICE: Got my chair today, assembled it, sat in it, (Really firm chair btw,. Had hoped when purchasing it, it would have been softer. If you've sat in a Ferrari, Lambo, etc. and felt how firm the cushioning of the seats were,..then you have a good idea of what this chair feels like..).  But I digress, noone is mentioning that damn screw you have to remove from right side of the  chair that prevents the recline function from working. I almost ripped the damn lever off before realizing there was a screw there stopping it from moving. Just something to be aware of...Yeah I can hear it now, read the damn directions, but I watched the installation video from SL and didnt see a section on removing this bolt. Note fo SL,..Other than that, the quality and craftsmanship of these chairs are par none,..I almost dont want want to sit in it. I feel like I'm disrespecting Danny, lol. Remember the screw!!",0,A.

However, we advise against doing so as the armrests play a crucial role in supporting your wrists and elbows, which in turn helps take the strain off your neck and shoulders.

Our full-metal 4D armrests are fully adjustable in four different directions:
1. Up/down
2. Front/back
3. Sideways 
4. Diagonally 

We recommend that you try adjusting them to a position that best suits your preference and needs first. You can also check out their exact dimensions right here: https://secretlab.co/pages/resources We hope this helps!",Secretlab,2,2020-07-09 09:44:27+00:00

I debated on buying this chair for ONE year going through many reviews. Worst decision ever.

For context, I'm 5'10"" tall, medium built, 155lbs. Here are the things wrong with this chair that are a deal breaker for me:

- Armrest is too far away to be comfortable.
- Armrest is too high even at it's lowest setting causing shoulders to be in an unnatural position.
- The chair is slightly high despite of being at its lowest setting. Perhaps if I was an inch taller that wouldn't be a problem.

FYI - here are the good things about it:

- Solid built especially the wheels.
- Texture and quality of the suede is good.
- Moving the chair around is very easy on my mat (carpet).
- Excellent lumbar support - by far the best.
- The headrest cushion is very good - though I don't use it.
- 90 degrees posture.",1,zx1701,2020-04-27 14:36:48+00:00,"It sounds like they are right, you may be better suited for the Omega.

I debated on buying this chair for ONE year going through many reviews. Worst decision ever.

For context, I'm 5'10"" tall, medium built, 155lbs. Here are the things wrong with this chair that are a deal breaker for me:

- Armrest is too far away to be comfortable.
- Armrest is too high even at it's lowest setting causing shoulders to be in an unnatural position.
- The chair is slightly high despite of being at its lowest setting. Perhaps if I was an inch taller that wouldn't be a problem.

FYI - here are the good things about it:

- Solid built especially the wheels.
- Texture and quality of the suede is good.
- Moving the chair around is very easy on my mat (carpet).
- Excellent lumbar support - by far the best.
- The headrest cushion is very good - though I don't use it.

I'm leaning more toward the titan because of the built in lumbar support and the more open seat, but I'm a little worried that the lumbar support wont work well for a person of my size based of some of the reviews i have read. Alongside that I wonder if the titan will be to tall for me, also what are your thoughts on the seat cousin? Lots of people are saying it is far to firm.

The reason for being so rock hard when it's brand new is because of durability, if it was really soft from the start it would eventually create kind of a hole on it and lose it's soft comfortability very quick. The seat will slowly give in over time and it will become more comfortable in a few weeks, depending on how much you use it.

IPy2xzj8BU4,"I'm 5' 10"" 140lbs meaning I'm at the top end of the Omega and the low end of the Titan. Is there a major difference in length/width of the chairs that would make one better than the other?",4,NJMoo3652,2018-10-17 15:16:03+00:00,"UPDATE: I have been sitting in this chair for the last month normally for 3-4 hours at a time and I have found it very comfortable. In terms of headrest space, there is still ample room above my head (I'd say 2 inches depending how you're sitting) so those worried about their head going past the headrest shouldn't worry. In terms of the seat, it has no problem supporting my legs. This chair has a design meant to hug you into the seat, which it does but isn't restrictive, so don't expect to spread your legs apart for than a few inches on both sides.The backrest is not as constrictive though, giving plenty of room to shift around but also keeping you in the chair. Out of the box, the seat is fairly firm but it takes some time to break in the leather and find which position works best for you. If you are looking for a more ""fitted"" seating experience, go for the Omega, or if you prefer the larger bucket-style seats, then go for the Titan. Be aware, this chair is fairly stiff when it arrives, it took about a month on continuous use for the leather to start becoming more malleable.

Fkey2ZvX6lU,"I bought the Titan 2020 just 2 weeks ago. Can't wait to get rid of it. The seat is so uncomfortable plus the fact that there is a slight lip on the edge of the seat that it's causing my hamstrings to tense up. What makes it worse is that SecretLabs is asking me to pay for the shipping back for a refund. They are selling ""premium"" chairs so they shouldn't be asking for S&H costs. Perhaps the Omega might have been better, but the ""ridges"" on the edge of the seats and no lumbar support was an issue for me. Perhaps the Omega might have been better, but the ""ridges"" on the edge of the seats and no lumbar support was an issue for me.

I debated on buying this chair for ONE year going through many reviews. Worst decision ever.

For context, I'm 5'10"" tall, medium built, 155lbs. Here are the things wrong with this chair that are a deal breaker for me:

- Armrest is too far away to be comfortable.
- Armrest is too high even at it's lowest setting causing shoulders to be in an unnatural position.
- The chair is slightly high despite of being at its lowest setting. Perhaps if I was an inch taller that wouldn't be a problem.

FYI - here are the good things about it:

- Solid built especially the wheels.
- Texture and quality of the suede is good.
- Moving the chair around is very easy on my mat (carpet).
- Excellent lumbar support - by far the best.
- The headrest cushion is very good - though I don't use it.
- 90 degrees posture.",0,zx1701,2020-04-27 14:39:39+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

Fkey2ZvX6lU,"Can one of your chairs come in a dark brown instead of black? It is impossible to find a gaming chair that comes in a natural color. I believe there is a huge untapped market of a ""gaming chair"" that can fit inside of a home and look like it belongs. Now don't get me wrong, I think your chairs look sleek and cool, very expensive and stylish. I am only asking for the same sexy chair in a warm color with a more subtle logo on the back. We live in a generation where gamers are in their 30s and 40s and at some point, it's nice to live in a home that looks like one instead of something out of a college dorm. I love my husband and I don't think it's right to ask him to set up a ""gaming room"" away from the central location of our home just because a gaming chair looks extremely out of place. I would never do that. But it is also a pain to go through all the work, painting, planning, diy etc to make the place look and feel nice to immediately be neglegable when the chair brings your eye right to it as it obviously doesn't belong. Maybe this will start a war on the comments but I have been searching for years to find something that fits my desire for a ""sweet homey"" look and his gaming fantasy and my search has come up empty. 
Anybody else think this is something that they or their spouse would appreciate?",0,Cynthia,2019-11-16 05:15:57+00:00,"Hi Cynthia, thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts with us.

Fkey2ZvX6lU,"I have the chair (the old version) the armrests are the worst piece of garbage in the world and its a shame they are on this 400 dollar chair. The rest of the chair is fine, but the armrests are extremely loose and the cheap fake leather they use to cover it rips off quite easy.  I've already had to replace squeaky armrest.  Also be careful of the reviews of this chair, MANY of the reviews ive found on youtube are straight up paid reviews and are very biased. Secretlab also does not offer free returns, they keep 20 percent of what you paid and you have to pay for shipping to return it. Despite this secretlab has no chairs available at any locations i've found to actually test out before you buy it so you are stuck with this uncertainty even before you buy. Don't get me wrong, the chair is totally fine and if it werent for the armrests i would say it was almost worth the 430 bucks i paid. My problem with Secretlab is their shady advertising and their goal is to make money, not to make a good chair for a good price. Anybody considering buying a gaming chair, try to find a brand that actually lets you use the product commit to buying it, if you cant like i couldnt then at least listen to what i have to say about the damn chair.




The Titan is definitely built for comfort over long periods of sitting. It is not comfortable like a couch or recliner. Its not some soft padding that you can snuggle up in, its actually quite firm and it pushes on you.

Znh1Qi8mVCY,I think the extended warranty marketing isnt bad it's actually really good for people with a set amount to spend not having to pay$50-$100 for a 2 year extended warranty is really good I think. All they are asking for is a picture and a hashtag of secretlabs and you get your extended warranty? It's not a bad trade off. Yeah everyone will see your post but most likely out of the hundreds of followers you have won't buy the chair.

Znh1Qi8mVCY,"I really liked the video. I've been watching a lot of reviews and I am interested in buying it. I think I really liked that your video seemed super honest and relatable in what you were looking for and what you got. I saw that a lot of people have issue with the warranty extension. I think the forced marketing aspect does suck-- however I think it might be okay for most people because generally they are excited to show off that they got a cool new chair to begin with, and also it doesn't say compulsory that you have to leave a positive review, so if you had issue with the chair I'd imagine they would still have to accept the post even with feedback and criticism of it. I'm hoping they wouldn't only accept positive posts because that would be VERY shady. But again-- I agree that it shouldn't be something you have to be forced to do just to get your warranty if you weren't interested in doing it in the first place. I am deffo interested in seeing how you fair with the chair now and your reactions to breaking in the ""firm seat"" that everyone talks about. <3 Happy to have found your channel!",0,Nadiahardcandy,2020-07-14 12:21:15+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

Znh1Qi8mVCY,"Had once since 2018. Felt like like the price back then, still does now. Only wear and tear is the pillow (I use it as a tailbone support) and the armrests (wobbly as hell, but the 2020 version should've fixed that with metal ones). No PU leather shedding, only a wrinkle or two. I don't sweat often, it's in a nice cool, dark room most the time. Most complaints about this chair tear are from either south east Asia where there is humid weather with poor AC sometimes, or overly sweaty situations. In that case get a fabric chair (there is an option for this in Titan chairs). 

Being real here from chairs sat on at family/friends homes or in store, this is a good chair. Probably one of the best ""gaming"" chairs (stupid name). It's definitely worth the price ($389 back then) and I probably wouldn't say that if this was above $500. This chair isn't just a price and marketing, there is a good chair and really feels like it's priced correctly. I wouldn't call this a Herman Miller (fucking Christ they brainwashed people to thinking they're worth second hand for hundreds of $$$ after they've had asses buried in and farted all over for 24/5 in a week, no) but this is a good mid range chair that excels in style if nothing else. Other chair's in this price range i've seen have less adjustibility, style, or comfort. As an office chair I'd say above average compared to everything in it's price bracket. You don't have to worry about wasting money when getting it, but just make sure you like what you see. 

Worth price, Yes. Good style, absolutely. Durability, pretty reasonable I'd say. 4/5 for me, no more nor less.",1,treymtz,2020-07-10 22:04:00+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

A nice piece of foam or a good winter blanket between you and the chair will get you a little comfort you wanted in the first place.

This occurs even when the chair is at its lowest height, so I've bought a leg rest which has solved the problem completely.
It's something others should keep in mind when considering this chair. It's an expensive piece of kit, so it's pretty ridiculous that I had to resort to buying an additional product just to make it comfy.",0,Phil Haynes,2020-05-23 08:52:03+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

In the end I went for the HyperX Commander+ from Game for ¬£129 (reduced from ¬£200)... fingers crossed it's not total garbage but the one I'm using was just left by a previous tenant and I have to use an actual pair of cushions with it, so it can't be any worse.",0,Social Jay,2020-05-22 14:31:24+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

2) How tall are you? I'm 188cm and 104kg and I'm not sure if my head will go over the pillow or if I should get the XL. You seemed to fit perfectly so I'd love to know! 


Thanks again and I look forward to your next review!",2,Cody Peterson,2020-05-10 23:13:31+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

Znh1Qi8mVCY,"The titan is good for a couple of weeks until the foam of the seat settles in. Then you start to realise that the foam is not thick enough right under your butt so you end up sitting on the metal square plate right underneath you. Have had 2 bases of this chair, first one i sent back to secret labs because of the issue. They sent me a new base, same issue. I weigh 85kgs and after 2-4 weeks the foam compresses enough that it no longer keeps your backside off the metal plate.

Znh1Qi8mVCY,"I totally understand you bro I see how it can seem a little shady with the warranty, but I don't think it's that big of a deal as some reviewers like yourself are saying. They're not asking for a 5 star review to receive the warranty extension. LOTS of sellers on ebay amazon and even uber drivers straight up bribe you with ""leave us a 5 star review and we'll___"" this isn't that. You are still free to upload your photo with the hashtag and if you aren't actually happy with the chair you can still write in the post ""this chair fucking sucks"" and you'll still get the extended warranty. You could even delete the post after redeeming the warranty. Its free advertising for them and a free warranty for the consumer. 
Anyone who is about to buy a 200 dollar plus chair is (hopefully) going to do their research before buying it beyond just looking at  some basic hashtag social media posts anyway",0,Saki Dickerson,2020-05-08 06:57:21+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

Znh1Qi8mVCY,"I have one which I use for working in my home office room.  For reference I'm 185cm height and 80kg weight.  

Fittings and mechanisms:  Solid quality feel and action, base is a sturdy die cast part so I'd hope this will last well and the swivel bearing in the seat base is smooth with little drag.  Fixing bolts are a robust size and everything feels secure once pushed or bolted together.  Tilt, lift and back rest angle adjustment are nice to operate and the lumbar adjuster has an indexed on the dial so you can feel when it's close to the end of the tension.  The arm-rests don't exhibit any play once latched into their designated position. 

Feel: They are unexpectedly firm straight from the box but I found that translates to good postural support for prolonged periods; combined with setting the monitor height correctly at my computer I work comfortably all day without feeling fatigue in my back or shoulders.  I don't tend to sit for more than 2hours at a time without getting up (usually to make coffee/tea etc.) so I can't comment on whether a numb butt would be present eventually.  The wrap round support on the back rest isn't that relevant to me due to my build but the general contour of the backrest is very good.  The relatively flat base is a benefit as you can sit in a more natural position with your knees apart as desired.  I opted for the soft weave which seems to breath and regulate temperature quite well.  I once owned  a PU leather jacket and it was like wearing cling film on a warm day hence I avoided the PU leather fabric for this chair just in case.

Adjustment:  Recline range is more than adequate for anyone and the separate base tilt with lock and tension adjuster helps you find the best position for your hips.  The 4D arm-rests are excellent, especially if you want to use them to rest your elbows on while typing or if you want to swing them round when using a mouse etc. The are a firm material but tactile enough for superb comfort.    

If I had one criticism I would ask for a few cm lower on the minimum height adjustment.  Principally due to the fact that when fully reclined with your legs hanging the base can feel a little firm in the back of the knees.  Given that the Omega only has 40mm lower back rest height I estimate that chair would still have fitted me and given me the cm or so lower minimum height.  However since the Titan has the integral lumbar adjuster instead of just a cushion it would still be my choice; after all the time I spend reclined is very small compared to the time I spend in and upright seated position at my desk.

I can't comment on longevity at the present time as I've owned mine for 2 months.  Secretlabs only offer the extended 5-year warranty if you do some social media sharing of your purchase, in effect doing some free marketing for them.  Personally I feel this is a bit of a pretentious requirement, if they really think the product is good enough to warrant it for 5 years then they should just provide that period rather than it being conditional on them receiving free advertising.   Even in these times not all of us want to share the privacy of our own space on social media and they should realise that providing a good quality product and standing by it is all the positive marketing they'll ever need.",6,Simo ST,2020-05-07 20:40:15+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

I guess after paying the premium price for a chair, I would rather snap a photo of it and post it for a 2 year extended warranty than pay an extra $50 for one. Also, if you purchase a chair, really like it or dislike it, you are going to tell all your friends about it anyway aren't you?

It started going down and down and down like you described as I was playing. I ended up raising it all the way up and taping a thick AF piece of duct tape around the bottom, the weight or whatever made the tape go down and settle, and now it's stick being like halfway down... So My feet have been bending slightly cause the chair is fucked up. It's been this way for over a year. My Secretlab chair is supposed to be here within the next 14 days... I cannot wait.

If so are you really sitting upright in the chair?

IPtEVqLsVIM,"Hey Stu, thank you for the detailed review. As someone thats currently using a Titan 2020 Softweave I have 2 major issues and maybe you could provide some input (cant find this compared anywhere). For you does the lumbar support move higher up the back in the Titan XL as I find the regular Titans lumbar support to be too low, if so could you quantify by how much? Additionally from the pictures an videos it looks like the upper shoulder supports are flater? I have an issue not being able to put my upper back flat into the top portion of the chair because those top bolsters dig into my shoulders. Those 2 things are whats preventing me from liking the Titan and im hoping an XL would fix that.",0,Jesse Miller,2020-09-07 20:31:42+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

Since you have both the Pu leather and the fabric one, I was wondering a part from the scartch and similar, do you actually get less sweaty after some time on the Fabric Titan compared to the other? or is it almost the same? I tryed an ""old"" Titan Leather some times ago and I found it too sweaty for my self and the type of climate we have here... So I'm still a bit uncertain on which to choose..

This thing is a beast! Also you can use the box it comes in to house a homeless person for a few weeks. It's nearly that big (and QUTIE heavy!). Chair assembly was pretty straightforward. I love this chair, the only thing I wish is that the seat cushion was a tad softer. But to be honest I'm VERY happy so far with this chair and highly recommend any large/tall/both person to look into acquiring one of these. They're pricy, but worth it. Thanks SecretLab and thanks Stu for your great reviews! (Also, I haven't felt comfortable leaning back in a chair in a long time. I'm always afraid I'm going to fall over.

Softer and more comfortable than I had anticipated considering so many reviewers saying it was much firmer than they had thought or hoped at first. Also, this is the first time I have felt the weight off my feet since it goes high enough to do that, which is a novelty for me because I am 6 foot 6 inches tall (my legs are long as apposed to my torso). I am also heavy and feel this supports me without being too soft. I will see how it goes over the next few days and weeks. I have a few back and shoulder issues and started to get sciatica symptoms recently and decided to ditch my Herman miller Aeron size C chair for this one. It is already far more comfortable and supportive for me.

While I was waiting for it's arrival I did more research between the Titan and Titan XL, and think that the regular Titan would have been a better ""fit"".   The XL is only 1cm taller with the same seat depth unfortunately.  It's really made for, um, being very polite, wider people.  I think for me the ultimate chair that they could provide from their parts would be the XL piston and legs as they are stronger and wider, with the regular seat and back.

The unboxing was the greatest experience and the quality is superb. But it looks like the guide arms/holes on the side of the backrest are slightly misaligned. So you can see it when the armrest on the left is further away then the right from the backrest. Then i stood up and looked downwards on the chair: definitely skew. I loosed the screws and tried to reinstall the backrest and there is some play - but not enough to straighten it up. I've contacted support so will update on their response. But if you take a gander at the first two reddit posts there are maybe 20+ guys since June having the exact same issue on the left side. Which basically ruins the ergonomics as well as the visual aesthetic. Puts a dampener on what was otherwise a 10/10 purchase. If they resolve: no worries. But it doesnt look like guys are getting a solid result if the reddit thread is anything to go by....,CloudchaserXI,0,2020-09-17 15:55:29+00:00

Simply search will show multiple instances on reddit where the left side is further back than the right (Spring side). I.e. the back rest isn't at a 90 degree angle to the base. I've just received one and this is the case. You'll find a few accounts of it on reddit. If you'd like to be as accurate as possible and help them stop doing this by drawing attention to it: it'd be an unbiased approach at the least!

In my opinion, your video is the best structured and comprehensive review I have seen, for that I have to thank you a lot!

J9BsxngbVEI,"Excellent video mate. Just a good honest review without the BS. I just pulled the trigger on the soft thread Omega. All the good reivews I read certainly raised an  eyebrow so I checked out product reviews as well and seemed to get a much morer balanced idea on what the chair was like. Most peoples gripe seemed to be based around hardness. I have a $150 Office Works chair which after 10 years is like sitting on a park bench so I'm sure I'll be happy with the Omega.

J9BsxngbVEI,"This chair has a counter-ergonomic design flaw. The seat has an incline up by the front edge. Combined with the firmness of the foam it really badly cuts into hamstrings (bottom part of thighs). This is more than uncomfortable and makes thighs sore and numb as it affects blood flow.
I had watched 5 reviews including this one before I ordered. So I knew the foam is firm. This actually suits me well. The size I chose is a good fit fort me too. But even with the chair set in the lowest to the ground and max tilt forward to reduce the thighs pressure as much as possible, it is hard to bear even over a short period of time.
I'm sending it back and am yet to see how much it is going to cost me.  It is really a puzzle how a chair which such an obvious flaw can have so many good reviews and none mentioning this issue. Wouldn't recommend it.",0,tamashumi,2020-09-13 18:06:42+00:00,"That‚Äôs a shame it‚Äôs not working out for you. I can‚Äôt say this has been an issue at all for me. I guess everyone is different!

I am in the same case, 183cm tall, looks like the same weight and I was ready to pull the trigger on the Titan softweave even if I was having doubts that I could also fit in the omega. Do you think I should sacrifice the lumbar support of the Titan for the more snug fit of the omega?

I think you‚Äôll be fine with either option, I guess the question is do you want to cross your legs and move around on the chair, or do you want to more held in place?  Also, do you want a set and forget lumbar support option or a pillow you‚Äôll likely need to move (or not use) each time you sit down?  I personally didn‚Äôt want a pillow I‚Äôd need to move around. So titan was it, I‚Äôm enjoying the freedom to move around and the flat base on the Titan a lot, compared to my earlier chair which had a more snug fit. Obviously I‚Äôve never sat in an Omega chair before but this was my thinking! No regrets here, hope that helps you. Cheers!",Ben Cad,2,2020-08-28 23:55:56+00:00

I've had a few shorter people (even shorter than you I'd say) sit in the chair and they have found a comfy place with their feet able to touch the ground. I'd say the adjustable head rest may be your biggest issue, if it is. If you look at the 2 other chairs I compare it to where I have all 3 next to eachother, those chairs aren't too different in size compared to the titan and they did not come with a size guide if you get me. Obviously I can't say for certain, i see lots of seemingly shorter people on the Titan. Hope that helped in one way or another, Cheers",Ben Cad,1,2020-08-24 23:26:34+00:00

J9BsxngbVEI,"Definitely changed my aim for the PU leather to the Softweave for this chair--great review. Now my only sticking point is sizing. At 5'6"" 130lbs I'm firmly in Omega sizing according to the site, but I like to sit cross-legged a lot and in my current chair (Corsair T3 Rush, one heck of a mistake) the bucket seat makes that position quite uncomfortable, so I'm worried about the same in the Omega.

I never got the chance to sit in the Omega, but I bought the Titan as I found a good deal on a used 2020 and I'm finding it very comfortable. I can sit cross-legged in it easily, and the height for the chair and the armrests goes down low enough for my feet to touch the floor. The back of knees is right at the end of the seat and I find it very comfortable.

I can't say how it compares to the Omega but I will say the Titan has a similar seat size to an average run-of-the-mill office chair. I find it quite comfortable, and I can move around in it easily - I think the Omega might have been too tight to accommodate my odd leg positions.",Jenn Gaudet,1,2020-09-21 20:44:40+00:00

I was thinking of going with a full leather but this review made me decide against it and consider the Softweave.

Thanks!",1,Andy Nguyen,2020-08-14 10:44:49+00:00,"Sounds like you could go either Andy. I‚Äôd consider which fit you‚Äôd prefer, from my research it sounds like the Omega has a more snug / hug-fit but I‚Äôve never physically sat in the omega. Whereas the Titan is more relaxed. So do you want some freedom to move in chair or have the seat hold you in? Personally coming from the other chairs you see in the video, I‚Äôve enjoyed having more freedom to move with the Titan, and the fact the lumbar support is built in and adjustable may help your bad back and be easier to manage?

I was looking into Secret Lab Titan or Steelcase Gesture...Im leaning toward Secret Lab cause i like car seats (Im driving VW Passat B8 with Ergo seats and im loving it) but im still indecisive over this. So, good office chair vs Titan? Thank you in advance! And yea, you lit the review. Cheers!",1,Josip Dominkoviƒá,2020-08-13 20:07:34+00:00,"Hey Josip, I like the car seats bit too. I'm hesitant to steer you one way or the other however considering I'm no expert on back pain and have only physically sat in the Secretlab. Perhaps someone else can comment?  What I can say, is I'm getting longer comfort than those other chairs in the video, and Secretlab say they've created it for good posture. So I would recommend it as a general use and I think it might be a good one to support your back pain. That said, there are plenty of reviews/and comments around Youtube that state the opposite re - back pain and that proper office chairs do support better.  I think it's a gamble either way you go. All I can say is I know its a hard to commit to the chair without sitting in it - thats was the hardest part it all improved from there. Cheers",Ben Cad,1,2020-08-13 23:04:30+00:00

J9BsxngbVEI,Thanks for putting up a nicely balanced review of Titan chair. I am still sitting on the fence trying to decide between Titan and Omega. I am 174cm only so Omega seems to be an obvious choice but wanted to get your views on the built in lumbar support offered in Titan chairs. Do you think it‚Äôs a useful feature or a separate lumbar support pillow in Omega would be ok as well?,1,Nitin Bordia,2020-07-27 12:06:09+00:00,I think I'd prefer the inbuilt lumbar support. I mean the easy way is grab a pillow and stick it behind your back on your current chair and see if it annoys you having to adjust it each time you sit (at least thats a common thing I read users complaining about when I was considering the Omega). I've had people who are of your height or smaller sit in the Titan and they have found it comfortable (only short test though).,Ben Cad,0,2020-07-28 03:12:01+00:00

Now that I've experienced the chair, would I go leather? Potentially I would consider it. That said, I am really enjoying the softweave material, its not slippery, it breathes etc.  Also for the price point of the leather, you are approaching the next level of quality chairs, which im sure are worth thinking about at that level.

J9BsxngbVEI,"A couple questions. Is the bottom of the chair where the base screws into made of that cheap fake wood? I am a larger guy who wants to get a Titan XL (6'2, 265 pounds) and one of the issues I have is they always break down after awhile.

How comfortable is this chair for use with watching tv for hours?

I have lower back issues (L3, L4) and sciatica issues, would this be a good chair for me? Thanks for your time.",1,Kevin,2020-07-22 01:52:15+00:00,"Hey Kevin, with the bottom of the chair i cant quite  comment exactly but if you watch the unboxing of the video there are a few shots of the underside. It seems to mostly be steel and metal that you bolt into. Most of the frame is steel from what I can see. I'm not sure if there is much, if any wood on here. But thats my assumption. 
Comfort wise, I can't comment on reclining it and using for a lazy-tv session, its mostly my desk chair. But that has been good for all day comfort. 
With back issues, I don't want to say it will or wont obviously every situation is different. But, I would say there are a good chances, as long as your condition is supported well by the firmer cushioning of the chair. They have built it with good posture in mind so it could help? 
Perhaps someone else can comment to help. 
Compared to those previous of chairs of mine that you see, this chair is built like a tank. Cheers",Ben Cad,1,2020-07-22 02:39:43+00:00

For durability, well a few months on (with covid use) and it‚Äôs still looking just as good so far. Thankfully no spills or anything yet. For leather you will need to treat it and oil it etc. So it really comes down to maintenance, I‚Äôve seen leather furniture that looks great at 10/20 years and also some that‚Äôs aged horribly.

I just wanted to check also how low do you lower your chair? To the bottom? Or slightly up? I'm 181cm and not sure if the Titan will be just right for me if I lowered it to the bottom.

I watched the Titan video on the Secretlabs AU website and it appeared the model who's 184cm needed to lower it to the bottom to have his feet flat on the ground when sitting deep in the chair.

J9BsxngbVEI,"I've always liked anything in this fabric in general. PU leather/full leather always gave my skin a weird feeling because it feels kind of ""sticky"".

But thank you for quite a comprehensive review, I've been looking for office chairs for a few weeks. I was thinking of Herman Miller but they're way too expensive for my income, especially australian currency. I've looked at noblechairs and cooler master but reviews say build quality isn't good or the cushion breaks in easy etc. I've never been a fan of ""racing car"" style seats as im more of a contemporary lover (Herman Miller) but for the price, I decided to purchase the secretlab TITAN  Soft Weave last night. 

And I'm glad you picked up on some of their marketing strategies. It really is ingenious and somewhat on the line of ""deceiving"" almost.

Its likely it will be firmer than what are you sitting on now, but also will likely be more supportive. So there is a chance (not that I would know) that it may help out your pain? Or then again it wont (sorry). When I got mine, it was firmer than what I was expecting but its totally fine for me now.  I will say this, in regards to tail-bone pain, I get that really bad in Aeroplane seats when travelling and I've never had anything like that with this chair. With COVID I'm frequently doing 12+ hours in the chair and have been pain free all day, every day. Secretlab do a have an info page on their site addressing the firmness concerns, it may help you. It comes with a learning curve and you'll need to adjust, and without a doubt I'm sure it wont be good for everyone. Committing to buy without a test-sit is definitely the hardest part, for me once I finally purchased that's when the Secretlab experience improved.",Ben Cad,1,2020-07-12 01:06:56+00:00

But in saying that there are plenty of decent review vids like yours by people who are genuinely happy with their purchase.  My Softweave Titan arrives in the next wave of orders in August so I‚Äôll find out for myself then. As long as I can have decent 3-5 hr sessions in comfort I‚Äôll be happy.

J9BsxngbVEI,"nice vid mate, what is your opinion on all the negative reviews of these chairs?",1,Chei Dawg,2020-06-27 13:34:05+00:00,"Ah I dunno mate, I honestly think Secretlab may be going *too hard* with their marketing and its scaring people away, like it forced me to do too much research before buying. I mean is it the perfect chair? I doubt it, are chairs that are twice+ the price better than it? Probably. I think Secretlab are targeting the people like me who are coming from those $100-$300 chairs that only last a couple of years, and for that market, its a huge improvement. Otherwise, for aesthetics Secretlab nails it, I mean I don't want 1) Fluro Red/Blue/Pink etc stripes all over my chair and 2) I don't want an ergonomic office chair that's makes me feel like I'm sitting at my desk at the work office (even if they are comfier and cost double).  For the negative reviews, the biggest trend I found when researching were the comments on the firmness of the chair, and thats probably the hardest thing to explain in a written or video review, so I think its fair its a common complaint, particularly if the user is not an all day user who can appreciate the all-day comfort this chair seems to provide.

J9BsxngbVEI,"I bought the omega and here's my two cents: ditch any gaming chair in general and go for an office chair. The wings on the back rest squeeze your shoulders and body together/forward, among other stupid design flaws. The chair has plenty of shiny adjustment options, but is designed with the intention that you will be sitting with perfect gaming posture all the time and that you will manually adjust the chair again every time you want to readjust your body position a bit. If you're a professional gamer, go for it. If you like to be comfortable, get an office chair. I regret my purchase, but I'm gonna take off the arm rests to see if it feels any better. My old $50 looking hand me down chair is waay more comfortable, only problem was the arm rests couldn't be adjusted.",2,Kyle,2020-06-24 03:02:07+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

I guess really I would say it feels similar to cloth material in cars.

J9BsxngbVEI,Im watching this while sitting on a wooden outdoor chair at moment. I'm not even joking.,0,Espen,2020-05-27 23:16:25+00:00,"my cheap ""gaming"" chair just broken... the back rest thing just brok down...i bought in oct 2019...",P√©ter Kov√°cs,1,2020-06-03 03:06:40+00:00
J9BsxngbVEI,I've had my Softweave Titan for 11 months now and have to say I'm 100% satisfied with it. Still looks as good as the day I unboxed it and is extremely comfortable. I like you was skeptical as to how much positive info was out there about Secret Labs but now after owning the Titan for almost a year can say it's well deserved. I spend at least 8 hours a day in my Titan and even though it's firm or possibly because it is it's the most comfortable computer chair I've ever owned. I'm 53 and disabled and prior to my Titan I was having to buy a new chair at a minimum of every 2 years. The way my Titan and it's fabric are holding up with minimal maintenance I fully expect it to last far longer. At first it seemed far to stiff to be as comfortable as it is but I can say it has truly helped with my back pain. They are however not cheap but if you figure in having to replace a cheaper chair much more often it balances out. The level of comfort is something else to consider with my Titan I never feel as badly after sitting for long periods as I did with cheaper chairs. Sorry for the TLDR post but I felt I should share my experience as well to maybe help others. I had my Titan in the cart for a good 2 months before I finally pulled the trigger. Honestly I wish I'd bought it sooner because believe it or not the hype is real...,3,Mjr Burn,2020-05-27 16:43:30+00:00,nice post!,Ben Cad,0,2020-05-28 02:52:21+00:00

J9BsxngbVEI,"Excellent review.  Yea, my chair shakes like hell also.  Jumped on this after thinking it over for 2 days. Went with the Titan Gotham Edition.  I replaced my worn out home office chair in March after starting to work from home daily (COVID-19) with a Staples model.  That chair cost 200, and the chair gets the job done, but it feels like it‚Äôs working way too hard (I‚Äôm 6‚Äô3, 215 lbs).  Every time I get up/push up from the chair, I think it‚Äôs going to collapse.  I figured I might as well get something I like and that‚Äôs of better quality (I don‚Äôt see this ending anytimne soon).  It‚Äôll probably go back to my office when I get it (they say shipping around 1 July or sooner).",1,John W,2020-05-24 23:32:44+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

On the note of the arm-rest bumping into your table, I did notice that the height of your arm-rest is too high from an ergonomics point (notice how your shoulders are shrug in the video when you rest your arms). Considering the amount of time you spend on the chair, I would recommend reducing the arm-rest height, enough to bring it in line with the height of the table.

J9BsxngbVEI,"The thing with new chairs is they are always nice and quiet to start.  I have a base DX Racer, and when I replaced my old office chair, it was the same thing.  The old chair made heaps of noise and had loads of wobble because it was well used.  The DX Racer was new and not even broken in yet.  Fast forward around 3-4 years yes the DX Racer is still  holding up very well over all.  The leathery material in sections are starting to begin to flake, and there is a lot of noise when ever you get up, sit down, move in your chair on the hinge that allows the chair to lean back.  I sprayed some silicone lubricant on the hinge and it silenced it up and the chair felt brand new again, however only for a few weeks before it began making the same noise again.  They also don't make it so you can tear it down to give it a good cleaning, and proper lube it up.  Maybe the Secretlabs chair is different, I don't know. 


Over all yes the DX Racer I have, even though its the bog standard base model is still a good chair over all.  The foam is still firm, the chairs construction over all is very well done.  The arm rests and the squeaking are about the only 2 things I have a problem with.  The arm rests this one comes with are made of a pasticy, foamy, rubbery type of material.  They have begun to wear down in the areas there are the metal plates under for the actual support.  Again materials like that will be the first to break down, and it did take a good time to start to break down.  Though comfort overall isnt the best, a proper office chair will do anyone much better then some ""gaming"" chair.",0,Michael,2020-05-17 16:30:17+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

You'll probably be happy either way. Think about if you want a pillow or proper lumbar support. I'd say the only thing you find a little annoying with Titan is the position of the pillow, at my height I do need to pull it down a little every few days to readjust it, I would say you would need to do the same with the Titan.

I'd be extremely confident even 5 years from now the secretlab would have a similar result, or if we tested with brand new versions of those other chairs.Thats just based on the difference in build quality and strength of components used which you learn as you assemble the chair. It's just overall significantly stronger (and heavier) compared to both the other chairs which keeps it planted on the ground. Thought it might help convey that difference to some.

J9BsxngbVEI,I have had my 2020 Titan for about a month and love it. Mine arrived in perfect condition was easy to assemble. The adjustable armrest are amazing and are a feature that don't get mentioned often in reviews that really make a difference in your overall comfort along with the lumbar support. My experience is the Titan is the perfect combination of support and pressure relief and no other gaming chair I have owned comes close in material & build quality.

First up, no it‚Äôs not like you feel the frame at all! It‚Äôs just generally the foam is a lot more firmer than you think (there‚Äôs a lot of foam there too). It‚Äôs certainly a lot more firm than the other 2 chairs I show you in the video. But, you don‚Äôt ‚Äòsink‚Äô into the chair, where you can feel you‚Äôve hit the frame or anything, it‚Äôs like the whole base is working to support you, and yes because of that it‚Äôs firmer. And that‚Äôs where it gets firm because this chair has kept me supported and comfortable all day.  I guess for the the VERY FIRST impression when I sat on it, in that first split second I compared the padding to a kitchen dining room chair, or a chair perhaps on public transport or an older school chair in a cinema, note I said padding not the chair. But only for that initial split second, I think you‚Äôll be happy with the chair but go in knowing it‚Äôs likely more firm than what you‚Äôre sitting on now, and you‚Äôll need a few days to adjust. After that you‚Äôll probably be happy with it. The chair is about all day comfort and not short term. I‚Äôm doing my best to describe it here, so don‚Äôt take my chair comparison here as a super serious comment cos I realize those chairs are likely negative descriptions to use, but I‚Äôm just trying think of similar padding. Secret lab also have a webpage talking about why the chairs are firm if you haven‚Äôt seen it.. they have a chart there which tries to describe how firm it is and they put it in between an executive office chair, and a wooden chair in terms of firmness.

I was thinking of getting Herman MIller Aeron but I'm not that rich to splurge $1600 on a single chair, and I got bad experience with all mesh chair. Steelcase Think is my second choice, but for ~$1000; it looks pretty barren and constricted to office use only. This can be used (and abused) for other purposes like slouching, cross-legged sitting, power-napping etc. Really hope this works out since my back has been screaming for the last 3 months sitting in a broken office chair.

First impressions: this chair is built like a tank, the seat and backrest feel smooth and well padded. I love the invisible lumbar support and the width of the seat accommodates my wide hip and thick thighs (just like Noah). Also, I sweat a lot in the humid hot weather (again just like Noah hehehe).

The bolsters hit pressure points in my legs causing circulation and nerve problem. The foam is very firm and never loosens up. This is a good thing if you want a really really firm chair like a board, but if you expect the cushions to soften up over time, they do not. So it is just a very firm chair that causes incredible body fatigue over time. I have back and hip issues for the last year and I was hoping this chair would help but instead it has made it much worse due to an inconsistent lumbar support (being a memory foam pillow) and way to firm cushion and no ergonomics causing pressure point issues. It's hard for me to say because the chair is so dope looking and I love how it tilts, great arm rests etc. I've been in denial about how bad it has been for my body because I want to love the chair. This is specific to my issues but I know YouTube creators get good incentives from secretlab to not talk shit so there are VERY FEW people saying anything negative.",John F.

My situation is that my room doesn't have the best ventilation (even with air conditioning) unless if the windows are open plus I have the hottest room in the summer and coldest in the winter and I have a kitty and my concern is that she might scratch on the chair.

They are different from yours in many ways ( I think yours are more serious than mine btw )  but I too have back problem from many different wounds and hard work and not listening to my body lol and I have less pain in my lower back and in the center of my back too between the scapulas since I use the Titan, it's not perfect but it helped alot :) .

But today I'm glad I decided to go to Staples and I sat on about 10 chairs. Even if I didn't know what I was doing, it let me find out what aspects I like and don't like. I haven't sat in a chair and actually a long long time like a decade and it was a $20 Walmart chair back then. No can-do on my old spine now. My neck is seriously messed up. And my shoulders suffer from squishing forward so my physical therapist has me doing exercises to pull back my shoulders because most people on this planet have an issue of pushing them forward. That's why the bucket makes me suspicious. Sadly I didn't fall in love with any chair I sat on today but I did realize I probably won't like these armrests. When I was sitting down I realized I prefer big puffy armrests where I can lean my entire body on it. If I wanna be in this chair for eight hours, I'm gonna have all kinds of different positions and leaning and just getting very comfortable in it. Seems like I would break a titan that way. But perhaps that wouldn't be good on my body and the Titan is good because it will keep me on a good posture. I don't know.

""The reviewer said, explicitly he was provided free product - no assumption required, this is called compensation."" 
Prove that there is such compensation. Not limited to just this guy. An email of from Official Secretlab asking reviewers to be their shills would be enough. Can't do that? good riddance, your point is absolutely invalid. 

""The claims I've made are self proven""
That alone fails to address the possibility of goodview coming on behalf of Secretlab and the content creator himself. You failed to give them the BENEFIT OF DOUBT. How hard is it for you to understand that?

here's an example of what you're doing

There are 5 suspects. If it goes by your logic, all 5 suspects are the culprit and will be sentence to death without further investigation. Now this case. There are 5 reviews, all 5 reviewers have affiliation links and their chairs were free, all 5 of them are shills. o.O. Logical to you? Having COnnEctions does not mean biased. You can be biased without affiliations or you can have affiliations without being biased or vice versa.

Also again, not his friend, in fact, im not even subscribed to him. Also, not secretlab employee either. Making tons of assumptiosn again. And why does this even matter to the argument?

""If a reviewer is provided gear, for free, that is compensation.  If, in addition to that compensation, the reviewer posts an affiliate link, that is a financial arrangement between the two parties.""

Prove that. Contact Secretlab and show the evidence, maybe I'll take what you said as fact. What if Secretlab say ""Oh hey Mike, here's a chair for you since you've done some review videos about our chair in the past as a thank you gesture, we would like to hear your thoughts more about our product and do give us an honest feedback on your next video. We also know that your video has reached many people, and we thank you for that."".  Most companies have financial arrangements as you mentioned, but not all. I'm a very open person. If you can prove that to me and everyone else reading this, then what you said is FACT. Else, it remains as an opinion still. 



""Point of fact, that is called bias.  Is this reviewer unique in this? No. Is the company wrong in to distribute large quantities of product for advertisement purposes? No.""

Again. Not a fact still. Since it's not a fact, you can't really confirm that this is bias. Ultimately rendering your main comment on the dude being a shill as an OPINION and that OPINION reflects a very bad character of you.



""The point stands, it does not matter whether anyone discloses a financial arrangement or not - there is a direct conflict of interest.  Whether you're besties with this guy or not doesn't change that fact.  I'm sure he's a good guy, but it's a joke how much product is shilled on Youtube 'objectively' in exchange for free shit and affiliate agreements.""

Funny how I dont even know who that guy is. Again, you made that assumption that I'm his ""besties"" which fact is, I'm just another stranger to him. I just find your attitude and negative perception of things and baseless accusations very appalling. There MAYBE a conflict here as you cannot prove that there's a financial arrangement or not. My point is, you can't just condemn people for being a shill without knowing the full picture of everything and neither can you fully trust what Mike had said. If you were to comment ""Useless review that doesn't help me"", it would have been fine as you might carry doubts about the content of the video and you find it not as informative, but straight  up saying he's the bad guy? Big No no. Stop generalizing things based on your negative experiences and claiming it as a fact, that's not what ""fact"" is. 

Recap: what you should have said is ""Mike ""MAY AND MAY NOT"" be a shill. If you are, hope you can be honest about it, but if you're not, good for you"". That would have been totally fine. But you were to stick to what you said, prove it with actual evidence, if you can't, then you're just another toxic individual rather trying to inform the community but to impose what you believe as fact.",Nigel Tan,0,2020-05-12 11:03:01+00:00

That does NOT belong in front of that little desk and all those (mostly) less-than-premium pieces of equipment... Let's just put it that way lol. The chair is a literal Gaming THRONE in terms of style and the contour of it is breath-taking. I'm 5'7, nearly 5'8 but I went with the TITAN chair because I read a lot of negative trust pilot reviews from people saying sizing was way off and most of these people were saying (basically) SHOULD'VE BOUGHT A BIGGER CHAIR cause their OMEGA one was too small, would hurt their back or thighs with that ""bucket"" style seating *(just the little sides that the Omega has that protrude from the side of the cushion)* also I'm on the Heavier side myself so I just went with my GUT and bought the TITAN, I hope I don't regret it. It's not coming til MAY 15th, almost a month after ordering cause of the virus.


I feel like the T and the style of the TITANS look better than the Omega's. It will be so awesome if it fits me the way I'm imagining it.",3,Anthony A,2020-04-27 12:34:52+00:00,ay how do u like it?,zramp,0,2020-07-06 03:06:01+00:00

And i definatly did so like u said and made a case opening at the German Verbraucherschutz. They are simply informed about this and im in case already in legal actions against secretlabs for scamming.


But the Company is somewhere in Taiwan and is just sending from England. They simply try to outmanofure every fact they could loose i such events and Secretlab even explained me that they do so cause there lawyers are going for that with there rights. lol  simply scamming at its highest level.

Problem is that you can't harass a company for your money back, if you want you can file a case under the fraudulent act towards them (I live in Australia so idk how you would do it in your country) but it is a right to be entitled to a refund under a broken product.

I've had mine for a while now and it's been great, I don't think the company scammed you, I think that you may have just spammed or annoyed them in some way that they won't respond, idk what you did tbh. Frankly I don't blame the company for removing your review, it's their site so honestly they are entitled to; you wouldn't expect a movie trailer to show bad reviews Heh. 

Anyways, talk to the professionals about it and try get your money back as your entitled to, but please don't annoy the YouTube community about your problem because then you just look like a spammer. 

Edit: don't you have anything else to do besides talking about your issue on every site, I mean it was a one time thing that probably just happened to you, these things do happen... I checked google and none of them have COME broken, you're like the one in a few thousand. Check their warranty fourms as well as there may be a good reason why they won't refund you.

Edit 2: read your second comment about the armwrests. I see the issue now, may have been an accidental fault but frankly I wouldn't refund you by the way your handling it. You're attitude can be the difference between getting your money back and them flat out saying no.",Crazard,1,2019-12-25 15:26:01+00:00

It could be alittle more sturdy...not saying it isn't but like shown in the video it has Abit of wiggle to them.

The left arm rest might also be a little higher than the right, making it seem crooked.

Although, I can't say for certain because it was a few months ago. But my chair has never been crooked.

It's firm, but not in an uncomfortable way---if that makes sense. I haven't had an issue with a sore back or with the seat getting too hot. For the sore back, though, it could just be from switching to a higher-end chair? What did you sit in beforehand? I know some people can get stiff or sore at first when they move to a better quality chair that promotes better sitting posture. So, that could just be a result of moving into something that forces your body into a different position than it is accustomed to.

THR7LdF4CpM,"Great honest review... so firstly thanks for that... secondly I'm a little bit worried about this lubricating the chair business... I'm about to buy their most expensive chair (the Napar Leather) one, and it's just under $1200... so to be paying that much for a chair and having to lubricate it, is a bit off putting compared to the fact my current DXRacer chair that I've had for about 7 years and I've never ever had any squeaks let alone having to lubricate it... you may be wondering why I'm changing chairs and why SecretLab... SecertLab is the only gaming chair in the world that has Napa Leather, other companies have real leather, but Napa Leather is far superior to real leather.... DXRacer do not have any real leather chairs at all, they are all fake leather (PU Leather)... so after 7 years with my current chair, still works brilliantly but the seating is in a bad way and really worn... so I considered getting a real leather chair this time around, and like I said Secret lab are the only one in the world that has NapaLeather... anyway, back to the original comment, so I'm now a little worried about this lubrication thing, especially when the chair is $1200...",1,The John Farnham Experience,2020-05-19 01:37:31+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

Cold cure is way better in the sense that no matter how long you sit in the chair, itll never fully go down thus making it comfier because it doesn‚Äôt squish down having you sit on the base of the chair (Like most manufacturers make it.) Once you get up the foam goes back to its original shape so overall its not as soft as a cheap office chair will be but will be way comfier while sitting in it for long periods of time. The cloth material also allows breathability while the PU or Leather editions retain heat. Since its a high quality cloth it doesn‚Äôt allow you to get nearly as hot or sweaty as other chairs and I personally think its the best chair I‚Äôve ever sat in. Definitely worth the price especially with the 2020 edition having lots of upgrades compared to the 2018 models. Yes its a high price point but you‚Äôre paying for quality and these chairs are definitely built to last.",Luticx,1,2020-04-13 05:17:04+00:00

THR7LdF4CpM,"Their customer service is a joke. Their ""fulfilment partners"" lost the parcel, then they were looking for it for 2 weeks. Finally got the chair going from a warehouse 250 km away with 3 weeks of delay. After my request, they proposed a leather cleaner ""worth"" of 39 EUR or a discount of 25 EUR. Mine is a Napa leather version allegedly worth of 999 EUR... And the quality is far from what I would expect. Apart from the surprising fact that only parts which have contact with the body are made of Napa leather, the rest is not even an ordinary leather - it's PVC/PU. They are cheap and unfortunately I regret my choice. Great review!",0,Pawe≈Ç G≈Çomski,2020-02-28 18:44:56+00:00,"Thanks for the feedback.  My review is entirely based on my per dial experience having paid for it as you say many others are not.

THR7LdF4CpM,I‚Äôm guessing that you may be using the chair at it‚Äôs highest position in which case the piston is having maximum pressure applied. Perhaps that‚Äôs the reason for the squeak....?,0,deans6571,2020-02-01 12:05:33+00:00,It‚Äôs not the cause of the squeak but the wobble that‚Äôs starting again.  However this is no reason for issues as there is no point having a hight adjustable chair if your can‚Äôt use it at the max length though.  The squeak it the tilt mech and SL do know about that one.,Mad's Tech,4,2020-02-02 17:58:05+00:00

THR7LdF4CpM,"Hi mad, thanks for making this video, I‚Äôm womdering if all these issues can be due to the constraints of the titan chair? 

Ie: does your weight/height fall within the titan category? Or could it be under the titan XL category?",0,Brian Chew,2020-01-27 19:32:47+00:00,I‚Äôm really bang in the Titan spec for weight and size.  I‚Äôm about 85kg and under the height limit.  I was on the upper end of the Omega but smack middle for the Titan.  I do wonder if the XL uses the same piston my self as I feel the issue is I‚Äôm using the chair at max height most of the time and then that‚Äôs putting a lot more pressure on the piston when it‚Äôs fully extended.   Weight wise the Titan is rated for 130kg.,Mad's Tech,0,2020-01-27 19:38:18+00:00

1CfHWFTDPVs,Greetings from Finland! Thanks man for these great videos! You made me to make the purchase for one of these. Now have an omega on the way. I used your secretlab link and I hope you get a credit for it becouse I had to modify the link to go directly to EU site. I read loads and loads of comments about those seats and that they are hard but after weeks of research there really ain't better options available if you want to buy fabric one. Most of them are leather/PU-leather ones. Keep up the good work dude!,2,lontti77,2019-10-08 08:25:42+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan
1CfHWFTDPVs,"Chairs in Canada cost even more. A $450-1500 office chair in the US can be $700-2000 here lol. Alot of office chairs are poorly packaged so they are damaged on arrival and they can be really bad quality too, even from brands like Herman Miller. I have only seen 1 or 2 ugly, but decent ones under $500. But the PU leather on my last 2 chairs peeled off in 1-1.5 years so I'm hopeful but skeptical of secretlab still. You rarely get what you pay for. Might just try secret lab anyway, there doesn't seem to be anything else worth it.


Can you stab the chair with a knife to see how durable the PU leather is brain? lol",6,ben,2019-08-23 02:24:43+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

If you are on a super tight budget I would recommend it more than some others (Homall, Vitesse, Ficmax, etc) Putting it together was easy. But it wasn't very comfortable, especially after more than an hour or two of sitting in it. The pads were very thin and you could feel the bands (not metal) that held the weight through the padding. Pillows were as you would expect. Lumbar pillow was basically useless, but it did include straps to keep it in place.

2KyjSROxe4s,"Dear Jian Hao,

It has been my lifelong desire to own one of secretlab chairs. I constantly thought to myself:

""What is life with secretlab?""

To achieve the answer to this question, I have also diligently participated in every single secretlab chair competition for the past few months. Every single day, without secretlab, has been a day of pain, sorrows and dejection.

So please select me as the winner of the chair. Don‚Äôt hold back, don‚Äôt be shy, just select me.

For, secretlab is love, love is secretlab.

My love for secretlab is eternal.

Ps please review a cooking showdown between Ridhwan and Dan.

And liked and subscribed to every single damn page you have as of now. Nothing will stop me.",1,Kai Ng,2017-10-04 15:20:35+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

A question about the Titan,  when chilling and watching a movie for example, are you comfortable with the top of the backrest?
My actual chair have this kind of ‚Äúwings‚Äù also and when I‚Äôm not on my keyboard and chilling back my shoulders are pushed forward by wings and it‚Äôs very uncomfortable.

I like the wings on the side for that, as I feel they support me in that position, but I can imagine if they bug you on other ones then you might want the bigger size, as that is what I noticed most between the two models, the distance between wings! hopw that helps!",TheAxelBrown,1,2020-09-09 22:54:53+00:00

qrXDFF-bTxk,"Hi mate, I own the black and gold titan and me being 6.0 foot on the dot is perfect for me. When I look at you in it, I'm sorry to say you're too big for it. 

You fit the Titan XL perfectly on the other hand. Maybe the feeling of being held in isn't going to end up being the best as the normal titan over time will begin to feel cramped, where the XL will begin to feel perfect in the long run.

It's like for myself the Omega to the titan. 

I'm so glad I ended up with the titan in the end, I've had mine for 3 1/2 years now and it is just perfect! 

If I had the omega I wouldn't be saying that. 

The Titan XL is actually the right chair for you sorry to say. 

Look at the video and look at yourself on the Titan, you can't see it at all. The Titan XL fits your dimensions perfectly when you're sitting on it by comparison. 

If you're also a bobsledder that's why I'm sure you like the song fit, but the titan simply isn't big enough for you the Titan XL is perfect instead.

qrXDFF-bTxk,You think the Titan could hold 150 kg or 330 lb only listen to 90 and I'm assuming that whatever they list it can hold a little bit more so if you're 300 I doubt it that makes any difference but let's say you were 3:30 and therefore when that case 40 lb over the the recommended weight limit what do you think would happen to the Titan,1,Xastur Speaks,2020-04-30 01:40:59+00:00,"@TheAxelBrown Sitting in most office chairs which list 250 to 275 I don't see them instantly breaking and honestly, like the Neuechair why they don't just make it rated for 330 like the Triigger, its direct competitor I can't fathom why they list at 240, yet say someone is 260 or 275 I don't think these chairs will break if going over slightly, and for the Titan/Omega I'd assume that 50 lbs might even be a good guestimation on a true 'max weight', plus it stats on their site: RECOMMENDED weight, not maximum.


But then I see in reviews people lay all the way back and even try and lean back and rock it a little and they don't fall back so these chairs seem extremely stable and would take great weight or effort to tip over.


Then I thought, if the Titan is made for a medium to large and the Titan XL is made for L to XL size, but their is a recommended weight difference, but the other dimensions are probably more fitting for someone, who is, say 5""10 rather than 6'0+ on the Titan as far as seat, length of distance for legs to touch the floor, and sure if you have a wide ass girth then clearly the XL is the way to go but for husky guys who simply weigh more, but are smaller frame than someone like you are who is clearly tall and larger frame, that the Titan might be a better option. Of course the XL works too and the real benefit is you know the weight won't be an problem but things like does the head rest line up with your head height since if you were not 6'5"" to 6""10"" would it be and thus the Titan might accomodate that more.


Personally, the Titan should have been designed with a 330 or 350 lb max weight, or 'recommended' 300 and max 350 or something like that, and then the XL made for the heavier frame 400 recommended, 450 max. Then make the XL cost appropriately more, but what your getting is the extra weight limit and height limit and for those who truly need it they can select this. I also don't like the way the XL lacks all the cool cosmetic choices.


Honestly if Midnight Blue or Graphite Blue in NAPA with, say, black swede trim, would have been available in Titan, or even Titan XL that would be the way I'd go personally. Yet, I really ilked the Omega with the Black Suede Trim, and like the Omega symbol more than the T on the Titan, but the trim on the Stealth is great trim. They seemed to dial back the NAPA leather options though.",Xastur Speaks,0,2020-05-01 08:21:57+00:00
qrXDFF-bTxk,You think the Titan could hold 150 kg or 330 lb only listen to 90 and I'm assuming that whatever they list it can hold a little bit more so if you're 300 I doubt it that makes any difference but let's say you were 3:30 and therefore when that case 40 lb over the the recommended weight limit what do you think would happen to the Titan,1,Xastur Speaks,2020-04-30 01:40:59+00:00,"So, obviously i cant recommend going over the limit, in case there is a safety issue. All i can say is that I've sat on the titan with someone sat on my lap and had no issues, but that wasn't for too long. So its difficult to say what the long term implications would be. How come not just go for the XL and be sure? 

If i had to wager, and again this is not official info, but i would say the weight guideline on the site is there more as a size guideline than the actual weight limit of the chair. I didn't notice any reinforcements or anything different when building the XL. Hope that helps! :)",TheAxelBrown,0,2020-04-30 13:22:12+00:00

The heat in California was intense last week and my room did not have ventilation. I sat and slept next to the chair for 3 days as I worked from home and I had no idea what off gassing was until I started having severe symptoms with breathing issues and now chest/lung pain. My dog wouldn‚Äôt even enter the room after I built the chair. It wasn‚Äôt until the 4th day when I moved the chair to the yard and the 5th day when I began to try to ventilate the room. I can‚Äôt even stay in that room anymore without having breathing issues. Now I‚Äôm wondering if the off gassing and poor ventilation  built up enough fumes to a point where it was at a toxicity level high enough to cause permanent damage to my lungs since I already have athsma. I honestly don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because i am sensitive to off gassing, or if the chair was able to produce a dangerous enough amount due to the heat/poor ventilation in the room to harm me.

They do sell a genuine leather model in the Titan, but not currently the XL Titan.",3,Blight,2020-04-16 00:55:17+00:00,"@TheAxelBrown PU Leather doesn't breath because it doesnt have gaps between fibers.  Leather does a little, but not when you sweat as it creates a seal.

Wearing no clothes on a PU chair is definitely something you want to avoid, and it will cause you to sweat a lot even without it being that warm - this feels yuk and will also degrade the pu leather much faster. Honestly even real leather you don't want to do that because even though it does breath a bit, if it is hot and you sweat its going to seal and you will stick. 

PU is GREAT, and good quality variety of it like this one will actually keeps its original color FAR longer than leather, however just don't go on it without clothes, or expect it to be great feeling when hot.",Blight,1,2020-04-17 22:07:36+00:00

It‚Äôs so hard to find vids of differently shaped people with the Omega, and no reply so far from SecretLab for advice. Like, does the flat part of the seat need to be as wide across as your hips when you‚Äôre sitting on a crummy couch, so it doesn‚Äôt crush you, or do the wing-sides cradle you like a comfy hammock?

N8uffnwYs9Q,"As an owner of a Herman Miller Mirra chair since 2009 (and still rock-steady today), I've always wondered what's the actual value of gaming chairs other than their styles.
Beginning this year, that question got answered when I bought a Secret Lab Throne (am a tiny boy). The immediate difference is that I can rest my neck and head while leaning back, which actually affords me an extra level of relaxation unachievable on the Mirra (but I sit on that for work). Which makes me slightly calmer while gaming.

Secret Lab's lumbar cushion however could do with some velcro straps to hold it in place instead of falling off every time I lean forward or walk away.

The parts were all over my living room during assembly. I don't know how you manage to squeeze in your apartment.",0,Riot Angel,2020-07-08 13:12:54+00:00,nan,nan,nan,nan

You don't have to be rich *at all* to be able to afford to spend ¬£179.
Especially as you would be spending countless hours sitting on it.
Worthy investment.
I'd understand more if you were talking about Herman miller chairs, but as I said, subjective.

there are plenty cheaper alternatives available for those who cannot afford that much.
'Executive office chairs' are comfortable, I have one, just a no name brand one.
there are plenty on Amazon etc for under ¬£100, they are a lot better for your back than gaming chairs under ¬£100 imo :)

As I said earlier though, definitely don't have to be rich to be able to afford ¬£179 for a chair you will use a lot.",Follow the howl,0,2020-07-08 09:46:47+00:00
